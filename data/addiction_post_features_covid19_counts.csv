2,addiction,2020/01/01,"I think my friend relapsed I haven't known her for too long, but we text almost every day and have gotten to know each other rather well. She got pregnant a couple weeks ago through a one-night-stand and is not in a position to keep it, so she just had an abortion yesterday, and is taking it rather rough because of the side effects. She's rather open about her life, so right around when we first met she told me that she's a recovered heroin addict and has been clean for 2 years.

I just found out a few hours ago that she might have relapsed early this morning. I can't say the source and I'm not 100% positive, but someone that knows her said that he found her bathtub splattered with blood with a needle laying in it. She got her abortion through a pill, so that explains the blood, but I can't figure out why she would have a needle there as well, and the only thing I can think of is that the stress of the last few weeks got to her and she relapsed. I've been doing my best to try and support her through this time in her life since she found out she was pregnant, but I worry that it wasn't enough and she just needed an extra something to calm down... 

We met on a business trip a couple months ago, so I don't know her family or have any mutual friends with her, I only found out about the bathtub through a fluke, technically I shouldn't have that info at all. 

I don't know what to do. 

If I confront her about it and tell her how I found out, that would only piss her off and end our friendship, and she would still be relapsing and learn to hide it better from her friends and family, since I haven't quite known her long enough to talk to her about things like that and I shouldn't even know about it at all. 

I can probably try and contact her brother, who knows of me, but doesn't know me personally, and see if I can show him the evidence of what that person said so that he knows the situation, looks into it, and can try and help her like I assume he did 2 years ago. But since he doesn't really know me, he might think I'm lying and brush me off, tell her, and then our friendship is over and she learns to hide it better.

I can just try and do nothing, and pretend like I never saw what that person wrote, but I don't think I can do that. I've really gotten to know her these past few weeks and we've opened up to each other about some more personal issues in our lives, and I look forward to talking with her every day. If I just leave it alone, I fear it will only get worse, it'll be too late to help her, and she might OD and I'll never be able to talk to her ever again. Just thinking about it hurts. I've been rather lonely these last few years, and I don't know if I can deal with losing one of my closest and only friends, let alone in this manner, knowing that I could have helped.

The only idea I have left is to wait a few days and pretend like I just found out that one of my other friends relapsed, and to ask her how I can help this imaginary friend. I can talk about this imaginary friend the same way that I'm talking about her, and hopefully she'll draw some parallels to her own situation and realize that she needs help. 

Unfortunately, life dealt her a bad hand, and she's been struggling every day to get by for a while now. Even if she does decide that she needs help, I don't know how she'll go about it. She's not even close to being well-off and is on the verge of being homeless, so I don't know if rehab is even an option. Growing up sheltered in an upper-middle class family, I really don't have any experience with any of this and I don't even know where to start, only that I want to help any way that I can. 

Even though I have some reason to doubt what that person said he saw, I can't help but think back to our previous conversations and how she would stop replying for a while, only to text back saying that she was ""taking a nap"". She might have relapsed a while ago, and I might not even know it. But maybe on the other hand that guy was lying and she's stayed clean this whole time. I have no way of knowing, since we don't live near each other at all, and I haven't seen her since I met her on that business trip. Maybe I'm overreacting and she just slipped up once to try and counter the side effects of her abortion pill, which is making her feel very sick, and that she's never planning on doing it again. I don't want to take that chance though, I've heard that heroin is a very addictive drug and that even if she was only planning on doing it once she might slip and start doing it more and more until she's addicted again. I'm so confused, hurt, and clueless; I don't want to lose my friend.",970,0.0,0,0.0

Due to a concussion I suffered a couple weeks ago when I  was arrested, I lost my job. My slumlord is evicting me and I have no where to go. 
I've tried finding a treatment center (it has to be in state) to go to through my insurance but every place I've called has told me they don't take my state HealthNet insurance. 
My poison is literally poison, alcohol. I've been a full functioning alcoholic for 15 years. I have tried to quit myself and while I was successful twice in that time, each time only lasted 4 months. 
I tried again it was not like the other times. I need medical detox this time. 
My body felt like it was shutting down so in order to function, so I picked it back up. 
I'm surviving on Body Armor super hydration drinks and V8 and vodka and as of today I haven't eaten since 12/18 because food makes me throw up. 
I'm a mess. My life is a mess, my house is a mess, and I'm trying to set it up for an estate sale because I can't fit 4 bedrooms worth of stuff in my car. I have a 17 year old cat whom I cannot find a foster for because let's be real, I can't live in my car (that has no heater) with her. 
But I have been so weak since Sunday. 
I have a heart condition in which my heartrate doesn't drop below 120. When I finally went to the hospital for the concussion, when the paramedics picked me up my heartrate was 160 and they wanted to give me adenosine again (they say it slows your heart way down but the second injection they gave me immediately after the first stopped my heart in May).
On Sunday I woke up suddenly (so I was sober at that point), I think that I had a heart attack. I'm not a doctor but after several hours of it feeling like someone was crushing my heart and like I had been given adenosine again even though I hadn't, I Dr. Googled my symptoms. I had every one that on the list.
I refuse to go to my local tiny town hospital due to the fact that any time I got for anything legit (like my appendix needing to be removed) they just call me an alcoholic and never take me seriously. 
I'm a 34 y/o female and I'll probably die soon if I can't get treatment. 2019 was the worst year of my life and I had wanted to start 2020 sober but so far I've already failed.

He is (seemingly/obviously but won't admit) addicted to heroin and meth. He's been doing oxy since at least 18y/o and went on a rave/Molly kick for a while. Bipolar runs in my family and I have no doubt he is affected. He is over 30 years old now. He can't attend a family gathering without being fucked up/falling asleep/super eccentric, etc.

I know my addictions are nothing compared to 99% of people on here but I thought I would share anyway.

I finally realised today I'm a addict, I'm not addicted to drugs but fucking video games.

I started from a young age, 7-8 with the original call of duty but it only really got bad when I was 12-13.

I did fuck all at school except play cod and halo before moving on to dota and league and my schooling suffered a lot.

My gcses where completely rubbish and I failed at becoming a electrician to.

But hay  at least I got to prestige 10 in all most every cod since MW and had 3000h on dota 2 with probably even more hours in league of legends (not to mention 4 digits spent on fucking skins).

And now at 23 working in Paris as a developer , I feel like shit all the time because everyone I work with has a masters degree and I feel like I wasted 10 plus years of my life.

There are strikes on in Paris at the moment so I'm forced to work from home but I find it impossible.

As soon as I try to work my brain is telling me just one game, then I give in and I end up playing 7h straight.

So this weekend I'm going to sell my ps4 xbox and gaming pc (work laptop can't play anything anyway).

I'm going to start studying instead and try and retake my gcse and A levels and try and get a masters degree.",277,0.0,0,0.0

I don't know how it got this bad, I never thought I could get addicted to pills, I guess it's a mental addiction more than a psychical one, but I'm addicted nevertheless.

I'm a 23 year old male, homeless due to family problems that honestly I'm not trying to make excuses but they kicked me out because I warned my own mother about her new husband and something I saw that I wasnt sure what happened but didnt look right with my sister. I've already had been dealing with mental illness and suicidal thoughts alone because my parents had their own lives, careers, and families that they just didnt want to put their time into me even after I was Hospitalized for suicidal thoughts and I had been abusing substances, whatever it may be, and they didnt even notice I mean one day I took some xanax and they never noticed. When I was on painkillers no one even noticed or cared to stop me as a child. My father beat me and mentally abused me, my sisters never were there or cared enough to be there for me or ask if i was ok during my severe depression episodes. Even after begging my mom and family to just check on me or invite me to go out or just do family stuff since I had no friends and till this day have no friends that care enough to ask or check in on me. I abused drugs since I was in freshman in highschool, first started smoking weed but as the issues got worse I just constantly wanted to escape or die. I was taking many things, ambien, acid, benzos, painkillers, sharpies, alcohol, and cough syrup while I was on prozac and anti depressants cause the o boy thing my own mother knew what to do was to medicate me and leave me tf alone and deal with it on my own and deal with withdrawals alone when I tried stopping as a teen and it was painful. I have so much anger I just cant explain it how much I hate them and have told them that. I wanted to get better I wanted to be someone who had a promising future but no they were to focused on their new families they just fucking kicked me out to focus on their step kids. I'm hanging by a thread to my life, I've been suicidal since 2010 and it's just getting worse. I have a job, been trying to get a different one that isnt toxic but I get so depressed I dont even show up to my other interviews because I just cant deal with the past still it still has the same sting and it drives me crazy I yell at myself for not being able to get rid of my past and the pain. I still hope for the day I catch someone on their bad day out here in the hood and they just put one in my head I could care less if they rob me as long as I can get a bullet in my head we are good. Currently I am addicted to substances that are way milder than the hard drugs I was doing before but it's still an addiction...I've been taking kratom daily heavily since 2017, and been dabbing heavily everyday since 2015 and honestly the times I've tried quitting, I swear my body was in pain and I was about to die. Mind you I dont have the luxury to not go to work, I'm homeless living in an broken rv trailer that's not very warm during the winter. I dont have any support or anyone to talk to me or just be by my side to watch tv or anything, I'm not going to get a dog and make he or she suffer with me in such a horrible environment I wouldnt want my dog to live where I live and it drives me crazy cause I know having a dog would help out but I'm in no position to care for one. 

I may be rambling I'm not sure but I just have no where else to express myself, I've had so much happen i never open up about it or ever able to explain it all. I wish I could afford rehab and have the support system needed after rehab but I know I dont. No one cares, and maybe you all may say that there are people who care but its subjective and most the time even people I hear that are supposedly great and caring end up treating me like shit so I isolate. I dont know how to be a proper person and interact or deal with social cues or the way social relationships go about. I mean make fun of me if you think I cant be addicted to kratom and concentrated cannabis but anything can be addictive, I'll admit I get addicted to anything that gives me pleasure or a sense of peace since in so use to nothing but hell.

What makes me more angry is that I have people who abandoned me and can help me right now but decide to just send me letter saying they always have loved me and whatever lying 2 faced bullshit they tell me but words are just words. They knew I was looking for help but no there excuse is that they dont know how to help, yet spend all their time helping others.

Some of the worst things I was addicted to was MDMA, snorting pills, and Alcohol. Nothing crazy, but nothing minor like caffeine.

After getting rid of the ""harder"" drugs from my life, I'm now overwhelmed by these 4 main addictions that seem to keep me enslaved to my depression, anxiety, and lethargy in life.

I'm a highly ambitious and motivated individual, but these 4 things really chain me down from my full potential and cause me so much stress, unhappiness, and lack of motivation.

These 4 things are weed, nicotine, caffeine, and porn.

I've been on and off with quitting these things, picking them back up, quitting again, you get the loop.

I've went through periods were I've abstained from some, or all of these things for a month.

But I always seem to relapse on one thing, then the another, then I'm back into a full-blown loop of these addictions.

Drink coffee to brush away the fogginess and tiredness brought about by weed. Hit nicotine to deal with my anxiety and mood swings. Smoke weed to brush away the anxiety and over-stimulation brought on by the caffeine; and to brush away the boredom I experience with life. Then watch porn to relax and take my mind elsewhere than my mental issues. Wake up the next morning, and do it all again.

I hate this loop I'm stuck in, but for the last 4 years I can't seem to escape the loop.

I am consistently involved in support groups for my addictions here on reddit, but I always struggle at staying on my path. It's so hard to quit one thing, because all my addictions trigger me to want to use the other drug.

If I get rid of weed, I can't sleep at night because of the nicotine and caffeine.

If I get rid of nicotine or caffeine, then I can't barely get through the day because the weed has me slumped all day.

I don't know where to start, and how to tackle my addictions one at a time.

Could somebody please help me find a way to get on my path and stick to it? I want to be completely sober and away from these things, as I recognize I have problems with them.

    I started smoking when i was 14 odd, since then i’ve inhaled lighter fluids, did some xans,mdma,coke,ket,speed,balloons etc. No, that’s not a flex, it’s so i can provide some context to my behaviour for anyone willing to give me some advice. I’ve never seen myself as an addict, but i’m completely aware that my behaviour isn’t exactly normal for a 17 year old. I don’t really know too many 17 year olds who get bored when they’re home alone so try to get a buzz off popping 10 co-cadamol pills and sniffing 2 more (:/ i know). Am i a drug addict? Ive had periods of smoking everyday for months but i don’t smoke anymore, but i’ll get cravings every now and then. I did xans on and off for a few weeks last summer and haven’t done them in over a year yet sometimes i’ll crave them too. I mean as i’m typing i’m literally so fucking bored i’m just wishing i was high on anything. This is my main point, im aware of poly-addiction but reading other peoples stories makes me feel like i’m obviously over exaggerating in my mind because i’m aware there are some teenagers who go through it 10x worse. Im just having cravings to get high on anything and seems I have done quite a few drugs for my age it’s as if there’s so many things for me to reminisce on and think i wish i was feeling that again. Ive done all of these drugs alone and at parties, ive lied about when ive used them, and have let them affect my mental health but the past month has been really positive but as soon as the holidays started (about 13 hours ago) im already bored and trying to seek a high.

Any advice is massively respected, sorry if this formats weirdly.",465,0.0,0,0.0

I have been also taking cocaine and mdma since i was 16, i dont know a life without drugs. I always relapse after about 6 weeks. I train alot in the gym but my weight always goes down whe  i relapse. 

My question is how long does it take to start feeling like a normal person again or have i likely done serious mental damage. I suffer from adhd and when i stop the weed my thoughts go haywire. I cant focus on simple tasks like cleaning or working anymore. Ive recently lost my job due to my mental health.",131,0.0,0,0.0
30,addiction,2020/01/02,"Seeking Advice Hi,

My Mother has been an alcoholic off and on my entire life. She lives with my Dad and younger brother currently. I live in the city far away. During my visit over the holidays I have discovered that my Mother's physical health is starting to decline more rapidly after a back surgery in October. I also discovered that she hasn't been stopped from drinking a minimum 3 large cans of beer a day. This in combination with her insane smoking habits, and lack of overall of physical activity caused by her depression and anxiety is sending her on a downward spiral with her health.

I've tried to reason with her many times over the years to varying levels of success but she has always gone back. I know this battle never ends and I accept that. My question now is it morally okay for me, as well as talking my brother and Dad into taking away any alcohol she gets ahold of, and ruin any cigarettes she finds in order to try and preserve whatever health she has left? They live in a small town and I have considered calling all taxi services in our town to try an enact a ""No Deliveries"" list for our home address, this is to prevent her from getting things delivered to the house while my brother and Dad our at their jobs during the day.

It genuinely feels like the alcoholism has such a strong grasp that this is one of the only courses of action left. My brother has left the house to live on his own for periods of time and has told her it's because of the drinking, which did not stop her and continues on with statements like ""It's my life."" or ""I know my own body and I'm fine."" The Doctor and Nurses have told us multiple times her health is very poor for her age.

Any input is welcome, and thank you. It feels like this is the right thing to do, but I just want to make sure.",351,0.0,0,0.0

Every time I do this drug again (cocaine) the depression it causes gets worse. I start thinking, ""How many fucking times have I done this only to end back at this spot I'm in right now?"" Like sure I can go back to being clean again but this drug causes this weird sense of despair and hopelessness and it feels like I should just end it all - but I always get out of it eventually. It's just so weird. This drug fucks me up bad, like it can take weeks for me to recover from the self hate and depression that one night of use causes - seriously! It changes how I think about things so drastically. When I'm clean from it things start looking up but one night of use and suddenly I'm back to despair and hopelessness and anxiety FOR WEEKS. I don't get it.   


I know that just like every time before it if I just stay clean I will be back to normal but right now it all just seems so pointless.

We became really serious 3 years ago I remember looking for her 3 years ago and she was homeless on drugs and lost it really broke my heart 💔 So I decided to help her get on her feet and let me tell you it was an EMOTIONAL stress !

As soon as she’s out of rehab which was a couple months ago she’s good she’s managed to have two jobs now . Then toxicity starts to develop jealousy we just became closer than when she was in rehab.

38,addiction,2020/01/02,"I’m still in denial (I think?) Well my title explains the f*ck storm going on in my head I guess. I smoke a bunch of weed, which wouldn’t be a problem if I could function throughout my day to day life, but I can’t. I’m a 16yr old sophomore in hs and I have court next Wednesday for my second case of truancy. Last school year I finished with 103 missed days in a 180 day school year. This year, the one I swore would be different, is already half way over and I’ve been to school at the very most 10 days. If I could look myself in the mirror and tell myself honestly that smoking so much weed is the cause of this problem, I would have a much easier time getting past this whole thing. But, I can’t do that. Since I was in middle school, I’ve always been a sad kid. Mental health issues run in the family, so it wasn’t much of a surprise and is certainly not out of the ordinary. Since I noticed the beginning of these feelings, my daily responsibilities have seemed like a mountain way too steep to climb. Sometimes I can get stuck in my bed staring at the ceiling for entire days on end. Going to school is the last thing I want to do in times like those. This has been happening since 7th grade, and I didn’t start smoking weed heavily until the summer going into freshman year, so I know my attendance issues and neglected responsibilities aren’t entirely due to an addiction problem. But, everyone around me tells me that smoking so much will only make my problems continue to get worse. I’d love to believe them, but smoking is the only thing that makes me feel like I can have fun and enjoy myself even when I’m doing things I don’t necessarily want to do. For instance, school. If I smoke in the morning before I go to school, I have no problem going. Everything seems easier to deal with and more manageable. My anxiety isn’t so bad and everything just seems okay. It’s no longer the end of the world if I have to go to school. Buuuut smoking weed is illegal and going to school after smoking weed is even more illegal. I just can’t wrap my head around how something that feels so right, beneficial, and healthy can be as wrong as everyone describes it to me as. I can’t tell if I’m addicted and need to find the strength in myself to change, or if pursuing a medical marijuana card is a better option and something that’s worth giving a shot. I can get a medical card as long as my mom is willing to be a “caregiver” for me despite the fact that I’m a minor. I’ve spoken to her about it before, and she said she would give it a try. I’m just not sure if this is the best route for me to take.. and it’s not like a have much time to make a decision considering child services randomly drug tests me, and I have yet to pass a single test. There is a possibility of me being removed from my home, and there’s just so much shit that I have to figure out in so little time. I could really use some input right now.. any thought?

42,addiction,2020/01/02,"Anything to help me get through, advice, book recommendations, personal success stories, anything Hi, so first off, please no hate. 

I’m 18f and started vaping at 14, a little bit after I picked up a cigarette habit around that age and ditched it. Lately, I’ve been dying to quit and my boyfriend (21) and I agreed we’d quit together. 

The cravings are the worst thing for me. I decided to quit cold turkey yesterday, and it’s hard because I suffer from anxiety and depression among other issues and I used nicotine a lot to helped calm me down. Over time, I’ve learned healthier coping habits to stray away from my toxic tendencies and have drastically improved in regards to how I handle my emotions but nicotine is the main problem for me now, especially since I tend to get addicted to things very very easily. 

I turned 18 after the law was placed into effect in my state that raised the age to buy tobacco products to 21 and so I wasn’t grandfathered into it. My boyfriend and friends were buying things for me, but my boyfriend is really set on wanting to quit which I’m proud of and support and I’m not going to be selfish and ask him to buy me things while he’s trying to quit so it’s time for me to call it quits too. 

So basically my access to anything is zero. That’s a start. Im going to throw away all of my products and everything is pretty much empty anyways. So I don’t have anything. 

I want to focus on replacement behaviors. I know my triggers, when i have caffeine, when I’m anxious or panicking, etc. so maybe I’ll have some gum or drink something for the oral fixation part of it. 

What else is there I can do? It helps that most of everyone around me is quitting too, so chances that ill be influenced by my friends are low. Is there a book I can read that’s good and might help? What’s something that has worked for you guys in your journey to fight addiction? 

TL;DR: quit nicotine, is there anything that has helped for you? If you have a success story, can you share it? For those who have quit long term, how has it benefited you and how you feel now? Does this get any easier?",413,0.0,0,0.0

52,addiction,2020/01/03,"Magnesium importance on chemical dependence - A brief overview of glutamate role on addiction so I’ve been researching a lot everything about addiction/psychopharmacology for a long time now. I have an extremely compulsive drug-seeking behavior. I had 6 main addictions over my life; the most serious being opiates, cocaine and JWH - followed by tobacco, benzos and weed.

there is massive research about the role of glutamate activation on drug-seeking behavior ([reference 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4633516/) , [reference 2](https://www.drugabuse.gov/news-events/latest-science/unraveling-mystery-glutamate-dopamine-connection)

NMDA receptor antagonists are relative new targets for treating addiction. ( [reference 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3816684/) , [reference 4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gbb.12348)

when you abuse certain drugs like opiates, your body is depleted from water-soluble vitamins and minerals. the main issue here is the B complex, which is completely essential for proper brain function.  [[reference 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4772032/) 

another important one is magnesium, a natural NMDA antagonist, calcium channels and GABA modulator ( [reference 6 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/30714574/) ,  [reference 7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507260/) [[reference 8](https://canprev.ca/all/magnesium-anxiety-depression-and-the-brain/) 



I’m 20 days clean, and am currently suffering from psychological addiction. all this new year’s partying are a strong trigger for someone like me. on desperation 6 days ago I bought magnesium chloride powder and started taking a teaspoon on the morning and another at night. yesterday I woke up feeling much lighter and overall feeling good. I didn’t even connected one thing to another, I thought it was just my mind recovering, and today I noticed a huge mood-stabilizer activity from taking the magnesium. 

***I took magnesium only after consulting my doctor. this is an experience report and not a medical advice, always talk to your doc before ingesting any pharmaceuticals***

it really is working like a light general tranquilizer. i’m not having the compulsive and intrusive thoughts I usually get, im smoking way less and overall enhanced mental clarity.

in conclusion it is doing wonders for me. if any of you reading this decide to take magnesium make sure you don’t consume the laxative formulations (mainly oxide and hydroxide). if you are quitting opiates and take a laxative you gonna have a shitty time (pun intended)

magnesium chloride is not the best formulation, it is in the middle ground between the best and the worst, but it’s what I have access to.

53,addiction,2020/01/03,"My ex is an addict and I need advice on how to deal with reality of it all and heal from everything that went down - it's going to be a long one, I need to let this out somewhere I've met this guy at a point in my life where I felt confident and somewhat good. I have mental health issues and I do struggle with addiction to prescription drug(s). It's an issue on its own, but it does intertwine with the story.

No one in my real life knows this. Our relationship was short and it was public but he didn't want to share his addiction with everyone so I respected his wishes. It was and is his personal journey and he should have the right to decide how much he will or will not share. At the time he was in recovery, or so I tough.

As someone who has issues of her own (that carry a lot of stigma) I didn't approach him with any stereotype in mind. I wanted to give him a chance to prove what type of a person he is, to see myself are we even compatible addiction aside - basically, I approached with open mind and open heart. Retrospectively I was naive, plain stupid and gave benefit of the doubt when there was no room for any.

I thought he was in a recovery. He was half-assing it. I didn't have a reason to doubt his story. He shared a lot of awful things he did, a lot of his personal emotional hardships, so I thought he knew me well enough to say he relapsed. I wouldn't judge him, but I would urge him to get back on the track of not using and now I see that *that* would be an issue. Not the fact I would leave. I wouldn't. I would, like I did few times, went to a clinic with him. But someone who doesn't want to get sober doesn't want support in doing so. Hindsight is 20/20, right?

I did care about him and that is why I didn't leave sooner. That also combined with him threatening suicide or relapse if I left. He made sure I know if he does anything harmful to himself it *will* be *my fault* and my fault only. He didn't just implied that, those were his exact words in more than one situation. 

I did break it all of after I came to the point of not caring if **I'm** alive. Our relationship ended with physical altercation where he didn't want to let me leave his apartment. I had to physically fight my way out. At the time he was saying I'm being irrational and he only wanted to talk. I spent 2 hours at his apartment listening how awful scum of a person I am and how I'm greatest thing that happened to him playing on a loop while he rolled joint after joint. 

I managed to escape, literally, and he tried to drag me back into his apartment all while saying I'm irrational and acting like I'm a crazy person since he only wanted to talk. He was holding me tight enough it hurt but I'm irrational one. He told me I'm embarrassing him because I was running away from him on the street but he still ran after me. I was scared shitless, obviously distressed and he was obviously high. 

He still pinned it on me. I was listening for hours him talking shit about me and it took me more than 3 and a half hours to escape and finally go home. For hour and a half I was pushed, pinned in a chair, tugged, dragged on stairs, chased after, restricted by firm hold and I was a bad guy. During all that I got bruise on my wrist (I do not bruise easily) but that's ok because he had a bruise on his head from me trying to escape. Since head bruise is worse than one on the wrist, it makes me one that was more violent. It makes me worse. If I recall correctly, and trust me I blocked a fucking ton, he bumped his head because he was high thus his balance was not all there, and I was trying to rip myself from his grip, so he lost his balance and hit his head. I don't remember hitting him. He's taller than me and in order to ""elbow him on his forehead"" it would require manoeuvre I don't think I'm physically able to do. I'm 5'5 and he's over 6' tall. 

After all of that, and million other smaller things, I carry a lot of resentment, guilt, anger and fear.

I'm scared he will show at my place, specially after last interaction that occurred couple of weeks ago. 

When we met I didn't abuse my prescription. At one point it felt like I'm going to go insane if I don't start again. I self medicated myself to be able to remain calm during all his shitshows. I was almost using my meds as prescribed until I needed that numbed out of my mind feeling to just go trough one more day with him. I should have left but I didn't want anyone's blood on my hands. I felt stuck. I felt trapped. 

He lied, manipulated, gaslighted and did everything he could to make a villain. 

I didn't heal. 

I don't know how to heal. 

How to forget and move the fuck on. 

He used every weak spot, every good quality I had and turned it against me. 

He made me purposely feel like I'm exactly kind of a person I don't wanr to be. 

I don't blame him for my addiction. That's all on me. I don't blame him for everything but I also refuse to blame myself for demise of that crap called relationship. 

He was hyperfocused on my ex. Talked about him daily. He rarely asked about me. My past. My experiences. He doesn't know me and after month and a half told me he loved me and that I'm his soulmate. I didn't reciprocate because I don't lie and specially not about things like that and he never let it go. 

I had legit feelings while I feel like he never had anything else but some weird dependency. 

That hurts the most. I did care. He did not.",1111,0.0,0,0.0

59,addiction,2020/01/04,"A conversation of our opinion on addiction between my coworker and I~ This is gonna sound a bit odd because I just copied and pasted it from my blog. Ignore it if you can. Smite me in your comment(s) if you want. 

Today, I had a bouncy conversation with a coworker I’ll call J. I use the adjective bouncy because we seemed to have spoken about 4 different topics in under 15 minutes. I like those types of conversations because it shows how much you can stretch into a single talk. For instance, the title of this post was one of the many topics we discussed while we vegged out at the front desk. I can’t be 100% on what steered the talk of drug and alcohol addiction. Regardless, he asked my opinion of it and I have to admit that I prefer asking other people about their thoughts rather than think it through, myself. I have a generic idea of what I think of addiction: it’s bad. 
So, I asked J what he thought of the subject and these were his words (paraphrased because we all know I don’t remember much), “Ultimately, they bring it upon themselves.” J and I spoke of some personal examples (he used to be a cop so he saw some shit) and he explained that he didn’t feel for people who spiraled into addicted because they should, at some point, find their limits. 
For the most part, I agree with him. Of course, there are days when someone may want to drink or even go as far as getting shit-faced, but you have to remind yourself of your responsibilities. The thing is, no one has the same situation and I really don’t enjoy generalizing the universe. 
The other side to this is people who either don’t become addicts or people who choose to seek help understand that drugs and alcohol outside of moderation are not good for you. Therefore, they should not make the mistake/keep making the mistake. That’s what confuses me. If there are people out there who understand then what’s to say about the others who don’t? Or maybe they do understand but choose not to change; therefore they are bringing it upon themselves, as J said. 
When I told him about wanting to turn our conversation into a blog post, he assumed you readers would scramble to your keyboards to disagree with him, but I can’t say I can agree with him. First of all, I don’t get comments. Second, I don’t know if there are too many people who disagree on his standpoint. 
I know some people may say, “Oh but addiction is derived from trauma and some people simply can’t stop using and don’t have the money for help.” However, that brings us back to the initial question of, “If people understand addiction is bad, why would they fall into it to begin with?” There’s plenty to dissect with this topic and I’m interested in hearing any other standpoints to this. Like I said before, I don’t like generalizing everyone’s situation so I can’t completely agree with J. However, you have to admit he does make a good point.",553,0.0,0,0.0

I’ve been a heavy drug abuser for a couple of years and developed an addiction to meth and pills, I drank a lot eventho I wouldn’t consider myself an alcoholic. I had no moderation. Fast forward years later and added trauma and failed treatment centers due to my location. I have kicked the habit on my own and it has been the longest I’ve been sober in YEARS!!! 168 days, on my own, no help. For the past 2-3 weeks my hunger for it came back and it felt more like needing closure from a toxic ex rather than the actual use. My perspective on meth was always so “chilled and laid back” basically unrealistic, even tho I kicked the habit for 168 days, my relapse needed to happen. Because of my relapse I have realized that my entire perspective and feeling towards this substance has altered. I immediately stopped myself from getting too f*cked up and went in fully accepting the consequences of the actions that followed. I am ashamed and humiliated and upset that I hurt those closest to me, but trust me when I say. It needed to happen. During the 168 of being sober I grew as a person as well I was able to mute the background noise of life and focus on me &amp; now after my relapse I’m almost relieved. My partner does not understand but I’m hoping an ex addict feels this too. It’s been years since I’ve been therapy but almost 14 hours after using and coming back to my sense I booked an appointment without thinking twice about it. This has never happened, booking an appointment when I was sober almost seemed impossible. However this relapse helped my realize my addiction was just me reacting to the deeper underlying issues I have, which I am hoping a therapist can help with. 168 days was nothing.

We decided it was time for him to get rehabilitated and he did. When moving back home, he stayed off Xanax for 2 years, and as far as I know is still off of it. 

I always thought the demon he was fighting was the drug itself, but in actuality it was his depression and anxiety. He managed to replace his addiction of Xanax to steroids and going to the gym. On the outside, he looks like a Greek god, but on the inside is a void. He goes out with friends and takes drugs (on occasion, I’d say every few weeks) such as molly, and cocaine, but is not addicted by no means.

Tonight, I tried talking to him. He opened up slightly, but shut down as soon as I disagreed with his suggestion of getting medication for his ‘anxiety’ from his new therapist. I’m afraid that he will become self reliant on these pills, and relapse. He explained to me how although we had similar “fucked up” childhoods (in actuality we did not have it so bad), my ability to handle it is different than his, and he can’t handle it, and it affects him every day. How every morning he wakes up, his mentality is, “here we go again, another day to live.” He then explained that one day, he will not be here no more (suicidal). I’ve heard this in the past.

I never got too deep into it to where I was shooting it up, or stealing, anything crazy that people always think “a heroin addict behaves” I got on a medication program, about 2 years ago on suboxone. The only issue with that is I do NOT like taking it, I avoid it at all costs, my fiancé would literally have to wait till I was asleep to give it to me, only because it makes me sick! Because of the TASTE. Ever since I was younger, I refused to take any medication orange flavor because it makes me nauseous and throw up, even with the smallest amount. I cannot do it. If I do, I have to take sips of a drink every 10 seconds to withstand it. Which is an issue cause I’m not suppose to do that, my doctor says. But he refused to give me subutex when I requested that, because I’m not pregnant, and he’s from a town where a lot of people abuse the situation. Note that I drive an hour away for this appointment. I believe that he thinks, I lie to him, just as a normal addict you think would. The first time He thought I was lying about how much heroine I did, he had me on full 8mg strips, which made me nod out at work even while driving! It was so upsetting he finally bumped me down to 2mgs. Point is, I feel as if, I would purposely not take my medication and would buy subutex off the street, and If I couldn’t find that. Dope. JUST TO AVOID THAT TASTE THAT MAKES ME LITERALLY SICK. I am very honest with my doctor, and one of the nicest people ever, I don’t want to take advantage of the system or him as well. I want to GET BETTER but I want to get better with taking a medication I’m okay with. Fast forward to now, my insurance dropped me because I made too much income, but he said I can apply for MOD. I waited too long, and now I have nothing and no medication. Iv been getting subutex off the street and if I can’t find that back to dope.. which I don’t get to get high. I get it to FEEL NOT SICK. I’m in the process of getting back on insurance and I found a place that it 100% closer, to save me gas, how can I explain this to the doctor to think that subutex is something that I prefer and if I had 24/7 there is no desire to ever get dope again??? They think I’m a liar because I’m an addict. I just got engaged, I want to have a family, and I want to be HAPPY. I don’t know what to do, I know if I keep getting suboxone, heroin will never leave my life, which is not what I want. How can I solve this issue without being treated like I’m a liar or anything else. If there another tasting suboxone I can try??? I need help and advice.",548,0.0,0,0.0

About 9 months ago was my senior prom. I'm 100% convinced that night will be the best night of my life for the rest of my life. I know for a fact that I will never ever ever feel that level of happiness ever again. 

Before I went into the prom room with my friends, I took 100mg of molly. I had done molly twice before but neither were in a party setting and therefore neither gave me the happiness that it did on prom night. After prom was over, my friends and I went to our hotel room and all of them went to sleep, except for me who decided to take a relatively small dose of lsd. I spent the rest of the night looking out the window and during this time reached a state of euphoria so intense that I cried twice. 

The timelines a little messy since I didnt sleep that night so I'll explain. Prom was saturday night, I got home sunday afternoon and slept the rest of the day, then returned to school on monday. On Monday I felt pretty depressed and all I could think about was: holy shit I'm never going to feel anything remotely like that ever again.

That same thought has haunted my brain for the past 9 months and I still havent been able to overcome it. I tried recreating the feeling multiple times with multiple different drugs, but I never got there. I'm now 5 weeks clean from hard drugs but I'm still struggling to accept that what I was feeling was an artificial feeling, and that I'm never going to feel it again. Everytime I think about that night I get depressed. I know I'll never be that happy again but at the same time my brain thinks there is going to be another occasion where I successfully recreate that night.

Hello everyone thank you for reading my story. I am at the end of my rope and I need to get this off my chest. I smoked marijuana for a year and a half basically smoking everyday. Jan 2015 - March 2016. That was the absolute last time I touched marijuana, during this time there was a three month period where I also abused ritalin, and benzos. I was stupid and in college and everyone around me was doing it, so I got caught up in it. Jan 2015 was basically the first time I ever smoked weed and I got hooked. In march 2016 when I quit cold turkey and the months that followed were the absolute worst months of my life. I was SO anxious all the time, was having panic attacks every day, couldn't eat anything. This lasted severely for about 3 months and then started to get better. Before I started smoking weed I NEVER had any problems with anxiety, or depression. Yet here I am, 4 years later been sober for 4 years ( Absolutely 0 drugs, or alcohol) and anxiety is absolutely killing me. I have terrible health anxiety, palpitations, stomach aches and Im just generally always anxious dizzy, and feeling like a fucking idiot. I eat healthy, exercise daily, I do everything right now, but I look back on pictures of myself before I started smoking and i remember how easy going and carefree I was. I ruined my life and I don't want to live anymore. I gave myself 4 fucking years to recover. I thought who knows it will get better. BUT IT HASN'T ITS STILL TERRIBLE. The worst part about it is I am pretty successful, I made it to medical school and I am doing well here grades wise. But I cant shake the anxiety and the feeling that I am NOT who i used to be and its fucking killing me.

The problem is, I believe it’s making my mental state even worse. For the past 4 months I’ve suspected that my marijuana usage has been intensifying my anxiety and depression, as well as making me lethargic, lazy, and generally unwell. My grades have dropped, I’m completely broke, I’ve been constantly asking my closest friends for loans, and I cannot find the drive to get out my bed and do something with my life. The worst part is I’m almost finished with high school  - a time where I’ve got to be at least a little clear headed. 

My usage also causes me lots of guilt, which only further worsens my mental state. It’s killing me, because no matter how guilty I feel, no matter how many times I tell myself to stop smoking, I cannot quit for the life of me. Even when I do make progress, such as learning to only smoke at night, it doesn’t seem to make a difference. 

At the moment, weed is literally the only fucking thing I care about. Nothing else. Its become my hobby and my crutch. It’s the only thing I can talk about, the only thing that will allow me to actually feel happy.

She was given medicine (concerta because she wasnt able to stay on track as she was at work, shes always been this way, when we talk she changed subject abit and after visiting a consultant she was told she had add .

Day one on the tablets she became quite chatty and empathetic, very motivated. Not wired but abit more happy. This stopped as the meds co tinued and she was back to herself. However after a few months I noticed when she wasnt taking it she didn't talk full stop. She didn't want to do much and speak to people. She didn't seem to crave the pills she could take time off it and not have difficulty but she just seemed depressed. 

Her consultant stopped the medication because she wanted to see how she did but had not said she wont be starting them again, I had not been informed about it but apparently when the doctor told her she broke down, saying she would gain weight and that without it she isnt herself. And the doc said this was not a safe sign. About 5 days after she was stopped on the pills (she was gradually removed off them) she stopped speaking with nme and didn't attend her job. I was very concerned when I visited her place she said she just didn't feel good and she needed a break. She said she needed to be on her own because her head was spinning. I was going to the uk the same day, when I returned a few days after me and her mum went to see her because she had not been speaking much to anyone.

this is my first post here ever - I have been looking at reddit for years and lately been trying to get my life back together. To give you a short overview, I am in my early twenties, good highschool diploma, top university business degree completed and currently interning with a consulting firm. So far my life for me appears to be entirely on track for everyone looking - I have money saved up, a loving girlfriend and family, great prospects for the future.

When I was younger I had a series of bad events and friends introduce me to consumption of various drugs and eventually nearly lost control of my life to the extent of being kicked out by my parents, losing almost all my friends and nearly fucking up high school - but managed to turn it around in the last second. I kind of quit - by saying kind of I mean i turned it into very, very occasional (1-2x / year) but started filling the gaps in between with other kinds of rushes. Be it nicotine, alcohol and in the past years also gambling (in the beginning with smaller amounts, lately with large sums). I managed to actually win quite a bit of money, then lost a portion of it again and decided to quit.

As soon as I did that I turned to drinking more and smoking more - when I try to stop I pick up something else again (even if it's ""just"" obsessive Gym going or something similar). 

Due to having a few days off lately I have been thinking of how to fight this addictive personality of mine - how to kind of lose this circle of ALWAYS having to have some kind of external rush. I seem to be able to say ""NO"" to one thing just to replace it again straightaway.

Oh my god I just realized that I'm the devil, I'm a coke addict lying to my family, friends, ex-lovers, myself, and the rest of the world that I'm trying to get better. Yet in between the inhales of coke in one snort and the exhales of snot, I'm still looking for that missing piece.

I'm still searching the floor pathetically from the crumbs and desiring for more. I know how this came about, how I became a coke slinging mind numbing and thought bending construct. I started by destroying my sense of self, isolating through depression, and crippled with anxiety I tried to medicate my-self away and tried to keep walking forward until I would trip over it.

Because the dumbest thing in the world is to escape the inevitable, change. So I'm the fucking devil, I'm the one manifesting into these shitty futures by hiding in my room like a goblin. I'm the asshole who chose drugs over my girlfriend and then my boyfriend, and then my mother, and then my sisters, and then my friends.

I'm that dick and I refuse to take responsibility for my-self, I've been trying to get that thing away from me and when I stopped therapy I realized just how flawed and hopeless I am. I am so frighteningly self aware that I live with crippling anxiety that morphs into depression and became the face of my hopelessness in addiction. I've gotten better in some sense, I've only done a gram this week.

My all time high was 4g in 2 days and Perocet pills scattered throughout and filling the gaps with random psychedelics to reflect on my glory days. Well I have a message to deliver to you, you hurt yourself by never asking for help.

You die endlessly and pointlessly by wasting your time, everything you made is meaningless and if anything harmful to your well being. Why do you choose to live like this? Give me a fucking reason, or get out town tonight and get a job, go back to school and learn something this time, and if you don't do something then shut up.

""I saw all the signs but I didn't do anything, this was going to be a problem from the beginning. I wish I had better guides and tried to combine awareness with hope."" -God

I'm lying I'm not really god, because I did have good guides and awareness, I just didn't have hope. I want to get better and honestly for myself because I'm too much of a dumb shit to kill myself already so I might as well just try to live for myself for once. 

All this came to ahead when I tripped on acid last week and I had this weird moment where everyone in my life was looking straight at me but there eyes were darted away. Like they didn't want to look at me and I wanted to get angry that they weren't looking at me, no one was seeing my suffering. 

I was like a little kid threatening to die but slowly because she was too much a child to go through with it. When you see someone jump and almost hit the pavement, empathy makes you close your eyes at the last second. To spare you the trauma. 

God I can't believe I ever thought it was anyone else's fault, everyone I love tried to help me but I never wanted any of that. I am struggling constantly in a process of having faith in the cocaine and loneliness as a substitute for everything I've lost, 

""There's no going back now, the only way for me to continue is forward"" and ""I want to back and change everything I did wrong""

I’ve came to realize the *internet and world* is full of arrogant and unforgiving assholes. Who don’t deserve to know mine or for that matter anyone’s story... My only hope is that maybe this helps someone who’s also struggling, and if anyone needs someone to talk to message me. I’d love to share my full story, but not to everyone, as I tried to do that four days ago, and was met with the rudest, most arrogant comments I’ve ever heard in my life. Ill try and reply as quick as possible, but between work and this extreme fatigue please allow some time..} 

     I’m a 19 years old *M*, I’ve abused drugs in general for the better part of 6 years. 6 months ago I was introduced to crystal meth, and made the absolute worst decision of my entire life. 

     I snorted a line smaller than one inch, and from there went into a full blown addiction. I changed from the sweet guy I formally was, into someone I didn’t even know. I met people who was so mean, cruel, and heartless, people I never knew existed on this earth. 

    I thought that meth made me a *better person, A harder worker, and easier to get along with*. **That is a total lie in which your brain is lying to you**. My ROA changed from snorting, to oral, then to smoking, and finally slamming. By the time I reached IV, I was a goner... I see it so clearly now. 

    I’m so angry, really I’m just pissed at myself. The withdrawal has been brutal, but **nothing** can compare to the self-hatred I have right now. I lost everything, 4K in savings wiped clean, a brand new vehicle that I had busted my ass for gone. EVERYTHING I had formerly gone in 6 MONTHS. I BEG anyone who’s considering this drug to RUN, anyone who’s still on this drug PLEASE stop using and get help. 

    Last but not least..., the only thing that was able to pull my head out of my ass has been my newly found girlfriend. I’ve known her for 4 years before we decided to become something more than good friends. This girl is for lack of a better word a savior. She has stuck by my side helping me beat this drug, and for the last 4 days I’ve been absolutely sure she’s had to think I’m crazy. Yet she assures me I’m not, understands it’s the withdrawal causing my mood-swings, and she **stays by my side**.  She has a daughter who’s only 5 months old. The father completely out of their lives. 

    My only hope is that I can be the best father this girl could ever dream of having. I’m just your regular 19 year old, yet when I look into the eyes of this baby... It gives me purpose again in life. If it wasn’t for these two coming into my life I’d still be nothing. Even though it’s only been four days, things in my life have changed so rapidly. I’ve *applied / am applying* for new careers, and am currently working daily in construction.’The future looks brighter everyday, and even though there’s moments I feel absolutely hopeless and just wanna give up, these two girls are the reason I keep pushing on. Work has been extremely hard on me, as I feel so fatigued I just want to sleep, yet I feel I must earn a paycheck to help care for her kid, my kid. 

{ So to wrap all this up, you can beat this drug. I know I will beat this drug, because even on my worst days. My two girls are the reason I keep going. I refuse to let her have a drug-addicted father. Thanks for reading.}",677,0.0,0,0.0

I was wondering if there were any people in this thread that are heavy believers in the Law of Attraction and belong to any 12 Step Recovery programs. 

I’ve been sober for 6 months now. I have spent  almost 12 years in therapy and the past couple of years have leaned heavily into Louise Hay, Abraham Hicks, Brene Brown, etc. During that time I just naturally gave up smoking cigarillos and drinking alcohol because I was focused on loving myself, but still struggled with marijuana and my sex and love addiction. 

In the past 6 months I haven’t had any real issues, but I’m finding that the negativity and fear based mentality in these rooms of “you need to do the steps or else!” And these threats of relapse and what not are not jiving with my inner being. 

I was wondering if there are any people out there who used to go to programs then left and haven’t looked back or had any issues or if they still choose to go. Thank you for your time, I appreciate it!! Have a great day!!!

I know the physical Symptoms will pass soon (last time it was About the fourth day I think) and finally having a clear mind again is what I'm currently really Looking Forward to.

125,addiction,2020/01/07,"I’ve recently discovered my sister is addicted to crack, and she is having paranoid thoughts. My sister attempted suicide two months ago.  That’s when I discovered that she was addicted to cocaine.

She was held overnight at the hospital and for a couple of days until some hack psychologist signed her out, believing she was unlikely to do it again.

She was back in the hospital a couple days later from another suicide attempt.


She’s back home now, but now she’s expressing paranoid thoughts.  This morning, she texted me believing that someone entered our home and returned a DVD to her bedroom without anyone knowing.  She is CONVINCED.  She also believes that pamphlets with rehabilitation services are purposely placed in her line of sight whenever she recovers from a night of  getting high or dreams about getting high.

I am at a complete loss.

I don’t know what to do or how to convince her to go to rehab/see a therapist.

I’ve been speaking with her all morning, but she’s convinced she just needs to be alone to get better.  Although she admits she only gets high when she is stressed and depressed (which is why she believes she’d be better off alone with no distractions to make her stressed and depressed), which is obviously nonsense.  

She also believes that her paranoid thoughts are an attempt by “us” to make her look insane so we can commit her to a “nut house.”

I want to help her as best I can.  I want her to get help immediately, and I’m willing to do anything to make that happen.  But I also feel like time is ticking.  I also discovered she’s prostituting to support her habit, and the next step is stealing to get high, including from me.

Ashamed to be making this post I (21M) just want to let this out somewhere. I just celebrated a year of sobriety after being on drugs for almost 7 years on and off. When I was 13 I started drinking which kind of led me to doing other things very early.

2018 xanax took everything from me, my car, my girlfriend, my friends, my college education, my freedom, my dignity. I felt so low and worthless, even suicidal at times. Basically my parents took me out of school and made me live with them again. I had been doing so good for so long I didn’t even think about xanax or any other drugs.

I’ve been struggling so hard these past few days, I recently reconnected with my ex girlfriend (whyi list because of the pills) who had been helping me but I feel so emotionally drained and in need of a xanax blackout because everything just feels like it moves too fast. I’ve been having crippling anxiety attacks to the point where I can’t move or leave my bed and xanax is al I can think of that would make me feel better. I feel like shit. I don’t want to blame my girlfriend but I don’t know if emotionally in strong enough to be with her again but I feel so alone without her.

Last night I bought a few bars of xanax from my guy and I had enough self control not to take them. Partially because my dad asked if I wanted to get out of the house and clear my head and I to a movie. I did and that seemed to work temporarily but in sitting in my room in the dark empty as I write this. I have xanax at my disposal and there’s really not much keeping me from eating all of it, I know I’m sick, I hate myself and I hate that my brain works this way.

The worst part about all of this is lying to everyone and telling them I’m fine, when I’m really not. I just want to be normal and live a normal life again. Don’t know if I ever can. This sucks. If anyone had any words of strength or encouragement for me I could really really use it. Sorry for rambling. I just wish things could be different.

137,addiction,2020/01/07,"Therapist experience in treating substance use This is a paper I wrote from my experience as a therapist working in the field of substance abuse:

Addicts experience something breathtaking when they can stretch their vision of themselves from the immediate present back to the past that shaped them and forward to a future that’s attainable and satisfying – Marc Lewis
 
How do you convince someone that their ability to make decisions is compromised as a result of something in their brain that is influencing the determination of their decisions before they even make them? This phenomenon becomes more prevalent on a daily basis when working with those who are suffering with substance use disorders. The predicament arises in the fact that because individuals are conscious, they believe they are in complete control over the decisions that they make. These decisions that are made, to the individual, are grounded in reason and rational thinking that is aimed with their best interest in mind. Unfortunately, these decisions have the capacity for self-destruction because due to the troubled history that each person has encountered. Memory has an integral role in decisions. Memory utilizes the past to understand the present to anticipate the future. If an individual’s past has had trauma and many forms of distress, their memory is going to ensure that their decisions are protective in nature. This means that decisions will be geared towards the avoidance of pain, avoidance of discomfort, the avoidance of stress, and ultimately, the avoidance of change. This is troubling because when exploring healthy life changes with someone, a therapist will encourage that individual to identify changes that can be made that will hopefully improve that person’s quality of life. That is where the challenge arises. Ideally, someone can gain insight and harness motivation to change to make positive life adjustments. The thing is, this does not always work out because something stops that individual from drawing power from their insight and turning it into behaviors that are conducive to a new way of life. This leads to frustration, shame, guilt, and eventually depression as someone who has all of the desire to make changes, just cannot put it together to make a difference. One begins to learn that the unconscious mind often has a completely different agenda than the individual. One learns that there is comfort in the chaos because it is familiar, even to the point where the chaos leads to complete isolation, socially, physically, and emotionally.
​When looking at the benefits of using substances/alcohol, it cannot be ignored that the effects of the high, produce such a powerful feeling of safety and security. The high is a safe experience and no matter how much pain an individual encounters, the high is there to shield them from the full impact of the situation. It is impossible to isolate addiction to one singular event in time, however, different forms of trauma are the one trait that all of my clients have experienced. I have learned that addiction always begins with pain and always ends with pain. The high feels like that surge of warmth and protection that comes from the embrace of a loved one or the love that was missing for an individual who never had the opportunity to experience it. It is no surprise that opioids are the endorphins that are released in the human body when a mother is holding and begins to soothe her distressed infant. Unfortunately, the high turns on the user and the individual becomes even more trapped in walls of isolation that are reinforced by bricks of shame, fear, and despair, but this is still a state of being that is desired because life on life’s terms is too overwhelming and unbearable. The frustrating part of addiction is the desperation to get clean when using, but also the desperation to get high when clean. Where does someone turn when stuck in this persistent state of hopeless of always knowing where they want to be, but never being where they are?
​The effects of the environment on the individual are impactful. Fortunately, this is something that can be utilized to foster change. I have heard that the goal of psychotherapy should always be security. This is a challenge in itself because if someone has grown up in a toxic environment with abuse or neglect, the body is going to not allow the individual to feel secure and thus change is ultimately prevented. I have seen and explored this problem through my work and through my own experience. The answer has to be connection. Connection to a person, who provides unconditional positive regard, like Carl Rogers emphasized. This person can be the therapist or another person, who can provide the stability and unwavering support that conveys the message that I am here with you no matter what your emotions and feelings tell you. The therapist/person has to show the individual through their personality and support, that they can be the safety net the person needs. This happens through sending cues of safety that help the other person start to turn off that flight or fight response system or the withdrawal system. This is not an easy process, but through consistent support, it can be accomplished. If an environment caused an individual to make decisions that are protective to adapt to that environment, an environment can also be fostered to illustrate to that person that they don’t always have to protect themselves and that there is so much power in vulnerability. Through trust and support, a person can learn how to tell his or her body “calm down, were not in danger,” and allow themselves to experience the freedoms that connection can offer. Through co-regulation (learning how to manage emotional states with someone else) with someone, a person can eventually learn self-regulation (self-soothe). They can learn that they can manage the pain that is inevitable in life. People will always experience pain in life, that is a reality. The growth starts when people lead that they don’t have to face the pain alone. Through connections with other people, those suffering with substance use disorders can learn that they do not need use drugs to get their needs met because they can get those needs through other people, naturally. Change will always be hard, but through support change doesn’t have to about suffering and can lead to new meaning.",1080,0.0,0,0.0

144,addiction,2020/01/08,"Anxiety at an all time high. Any advice?! My story is kinda long but here it goes anyways...

I got in a car accident 9 years ago and shattered my pelvis and broke my hip. I was in the hospital for a few months and then had to re-learn to walk, do physical therapy, the whole usual ordeal. That accident brings me to where I am now, 9 years later, addicted to opioids. I have basically taken them off and on, mostly on, since that accident. There has been A LOT that has gone in these last 9 years but it would take a book to explain it all, so Ill just talk about the last 3-4 years.

Before the accident, I had never taken any kind of pill other then tylenol/advil so Id say most of my current issues stem from within the past 9 years. Anyways, Ive been prescribed 3-4 10/325 oxycodones/day for the past couple years. I used to take them how they were prescribed and to be honest, I dont even know how/when I got this bad off. But for the past couple years, I would get my prescription and instead of taking 4/day, I would take 6-8/day. I never took two at a time but instead of taking them every 4-6 hours, I would take one every two hours, give or take 30 mins. Meaning I would usually run out almost two weeks early. 

So for the next two weeks I would trade my adderall for someone I knows hydrocodone. The hydrocodone didnt help my like the oxycodone did, but I felt like it helped enough that I wouldnt go into full withdrawals if that makes sense. Also note, I couldnt get an unlimited supply of hydrocodone or anything, I normally got enough of the 10mg hydros to take only 2-3/day, so I definitely had to somewhat control myself during that time. I never bought anything off the street or tried anything else. However, every month I told myself, Im going to take my meds the way Im supposed to take them, I HATED always worrying about pills...if I had them, would I be able to get them, how many could I get, etc. Which brings me back to how it literally CONSUMED me. Always in the back of my mind though was the actual, REAL pain I have in my lower back. Without pain meds, how would that be controlled?? Mind you Ive tried 3-4 different type of injections, physical therapy, non narcotics, etc. because at the end of the day I just dont want to be in this kinda pain but again, at the same time these pain pills have completely changed me as a person. Wheres the balance?! 

For the past couple months, I have been thinking REALLY hard about how I want to end this cycle but Ive never been strong enough to do it, until yesterday. I went to my pain management doctor and did the usual spiel and finally broke down and told him I want to get off the pills. He agreed with me, I could tell for the past few months he wanted me off the narcotics  (which only added to my stress and anxiety..when would the time come that he would just stop prescribing them?? These are things that constantly ran through my head) but I was kind of passed to him from my other doctor who moved away and I guess since I had always complied and also tried several other things to try and help the pain, he never took them away. So he prescribed me like 5 other meds to help with the withdrawals and also called a personal doctor friend who works on the addiction side, as he said, who would be able to help with my dependency (addiction? I loathe that word). So the last pain pill I took was half of a 10mg hydrocodone at 8:30pm Monday night. (I took 3 10mg altogether that day) I went and got the meds he prescribed filled, although my pharmacy was out of two of them and they had to order them, hopefully they will come in today. Anyways, after that I went to work like normal and was actually not to bad off, minus my crying like a baby on and off while I texted my mom and dad about whats going on. I know my mom had some idea of how bad I was but my dad, who lives 3 hours away, had no clue. None of my friends know about this nor does any of the rest of my family including my siblings and step parents. Its mortifying and I dont want anyone else to know about it to be quite honest. 

So back to my main story, sorry I like to ramble. So my pain management doctors, doctor friend who works the “other side” of this, had his office call me within an hour of me leaving my doctors appt. She said the doctor could get me in Thursday morning (tomorrow) and asked the basic questions about insurance and stuff. I do have insurance but of course its one of the only ones that doctor doesnt accept, so my first appt will be $400 bc she said its a longer appt and I asked what all it entails. She said basically he will talk to me and find out what my issues are and most likely prescribe me suboxone, just ONE, that I will have to take and get filled at the pharmacy, bring back to the doctors office and take half in front of him? Then wait around so he can see and make sure I dont have any negative side effects and then Ill be able to leave. She didnt say anything more so I am guessing if the suboxone agrees with me, I will be given a script for it for a month and then have to follow back up with him in a month. Does this sound likely what is to happen?

Aside from everything that happened with the doctors yesterday, here I am I guess about 36 hours after my last dose and I dont feel like Im dying or anything but I dont feel good either. I called into work this morning and Im also thinking about calling into my second job this afternoon, although I really need to be working. I feel tired more then anything, that and my back hurts. Im probably killing my liver with acetaminophen. Last night I was able to work almost my whole shift, I left two hours early because I just couldnt make myself work any longer. Im also having terrible anxiety. Ive had bad anxiety for years and used to be prescribed xanax, however, last year the doctors said there have been new studies done and they werent going to be prescribing pain meds and xanax anymore so I went off the xanax, which I never had an issue with that anyways. I only took it as needed, so not even everyday, it honestly wasnt hard to give up but holy fuck, I wish I had one right now. Im also just so so tired. I even took my adderall and Im still tired as shit. I have no motivation whatsoever, which I didnt have much while on the pills, not now it’s literally non existent. I know Ive read other peoples stories on different subs who sound like they’ve had it way worse than me and Im sure I sound like a big ass baby, Im just so pissed at myself for doing this to myself to begin with and now Im having a pity party.

So I guess my questions are, how much worse will this get before it starts to get better? How long until I feel normal again? What should I expect from taking suboxone? Is there anything I can do now (like right now, today) to feel better, cut down on the anxiety, whatever? Ive read on here about something called Kratom, should I try that? I first read about it on another sub a couple months ago and have been thinking about trying it since then but Im honestly kind of scared since I dont know how itll effect me. I also do not smoke or drink, tried weed in the past, years ago, not my thing.

Im looking forward to getting my LIFE back. The pills have completely changed me as a person. I used to be very social, had lots of friends, always on the go. Now, I dont do anything but work and lay on my couch. Im lazy as fuck, depressed as fuck and honestly probably wouldnt even leave the house if it wasnt for work and my dog. I rarely see my friends and when I do its because I have to force myself. Im just tried of living like this. Any help or advice is very much appreciated!!!!

150,addiction,2020/01/08,"When does it get better? Been off Adderall for 2 months Hi redditors,
I need some opinions and encouragement bc I have been feeling pretty hopeless and depressive recently.

I had been using Adderall for almost 1.5 years. I was 19 when I started and I’m 21 now. I was also a heavy weed user for a year during that. My dose was initially low but towards the end I started taking high amounts. This is how my usage looks. I took 15mg for 3 months then I took a one month break. After the break I started taking 20-30mg a day for 3.5 months. After that I stopped taking it for 3 months. For the next 2.5 months, I started taking 20mg a day and moved up to 60mg(took for 1-2 weeks). I started feeling restless, hopeless, depressed and getting panic attacks. I haven’t been taking any for 2 months but I still feel brain fog, depression, and anxiety, which I never felt before. Therefore, I feel like this time it is not a break and I’m quitting it for good. After I stopped taking it I started feeling extremely hopeless and depressed for no reason. I was also having panic attacks. I should also mentioned that my apetite was pretty low even 2-3 week after quitting and I have no history of mental illness. I’m wondering how severe does my usage look?

I have worked through the worst. And gotten over the depression. But the addiction has grown roots. It is only a 1-3 times a month thing but that impacts the entirety of it. And that brings the sadness and loneliness. For I use by myself. 

It has severely impacted my career and my relationships with friends and family. I have admitted to my parents and one close friend of my problem and earnest to seek help. I attend a 12 step program every weekend and group therapy three times a week. And yet it creeps back.

Before I continue I guess I should give some information about my boyfriend: 

He’s 21, in college, and he struggles from depression. He used to get high a lot behind my back, had a fake med card that he willingly gave me to destroy. He went through THC withdrawal and was seriously tired and sick because of it. That’s gotten better. My main concern is that he’s resorted to other outlets to escape his problems. He sleeps a lot mainly but lately he’s been getting drunk by noon and he’s stolen adderall from his friend twice. He can’t control himself if it’s in his presence; although I will be moving in by March, I can’t baby him and be controlling. 

He just started therapy and has been on his antidepressants for some time now, yet he still feels like he can never get better. He wants to sober up, he always feels guilty when he gets drunk or sleeps a lot which creates this loop of escaping his problems in the way he does and feeling guilty. I’ve tried being there for him whenever I can, and some days he feels better than others. I try to remind him that it takes time to get better and that no addict really knows when or how to start getting better, that it’s gonna be trial and error until he finds something that works for him.

162,addiction,2020/01/09,"Advice on Helping Cocaine/ Alcohol Addict My best friend of a decade relapsed after being off cocaine for months. I am trying to help them get clean, and healthy without enabling them but I am having a hard time figuring out where to draw the line. 

Little bit of background: I have known them since we were kids. They have always struggled with extreme anxiety and chronic depression. Their substance abuse issues have developed as unhealthy coping mechanisms. I have tried to encourage them to seek treatment but they have been unwilling until now to do anything but self medicate. They know they are an alcoholic but have continued to drink. They constantly have smoked weed since college. That progressed to cocaine abuse. 

They finally saw the damage that cocaine had done to themselves and their relationships (including our friendship) and managed to make it nearly a year without using again. However, they continued to smoke and drink. I hoped it would last but everything I read said that most addicts need to quit all substances or risk relapse. 

I wasn't able to visit or see them for a few months. I was struggling too and we fell out of contact for a while. I talked to them right after Christmas and they said they were really depressed again. Their anxiety had flared up too and they weren't able to do everyday tasks. They sounded serious when they said that they needed and wanted professional help. I agreed to come help them sort out some of the everyday stuff (cleaning, shopping, etc.) and help them find a therapist. They admitted that they probably would have killed themselves if I hadn't. 

I suspected that they were using again. When I saw them, they were so underweight that it looked like they had starved. They barely eat, or sleep. 

Present Day: They admitted they are using again. They said they want to stop but are afraid that they won't be able to keep their life together if they do. I hate the idea of  them continuing to use. I don't want to be around it. They also admitted that they live with people who also use. 

I don't want to make them feel bad about struggling or feel like they can't confide in people.  I think if I tried to get them to stop right now that they will clam up and won't get any help at all. It seems like they are wavering between wanting help and being able to still use. I also realize that they may have to solve one problem at a time and seeking help for their mental health issues may help them recover from substance abuse. 

How should I handle this? What boundaries can I put in place to make sure they aren't taking advantage of me and that I am not enabling them while still helping my friend? I want to help them feel less anxious by taking care of the everyday stuff so they can focus on finding the energy for therapy but I am afraid that if things get better they will dismiss how serious their mental health and addiction issues are.",538,0.0,0,0.0

Like a preparation to justify why you can't stop yourself. Your hands will move of their own accord, like a waking dream. Your inner mind yells ""stop"" but only a sinister laugh echos back.

I'm not overweight. That's, I think, why it's so hard for me to ask for help. I look pretty normal. I'm tall, well proportioned.

Honestly, I'm backpacking through Europe right now, and can't even *say* the word therapist in most languages here.

167,addiction,2020/01/09,"7 years of smoking cones daily Throwaway for obvious reasons

I'm 24 and started smoking weed daily from 17. I was doing it with friends who i grew apart from at about 19/20.
Before I started smoking I was a happy outgoing cunt who loved life.

For the last 3 years I've said I wanted to stop everytime I smoked I just couldn't stick to it.
There were 2 or 3 month periods where I did, but it never lasted as I'd see an old friend and have a cone thinking I could keep my discipline. I was wrong everytime and it became a daily thing I did alone again.
I'm now this extremely critical self conscious asshole who dislikes himself a lot.
End of 2018 I quit for 5 months and began running 5-7kms a day, I was also powerlifting and hit a 230kg squat. 

I felt like I had beat the addiction. So in March 2019 I thought I'd try and pick up a cool hobby like skydiving, I jumped a few times and thought I'd go for a solo license, unfortunately the dude who was directing my landing was new and I shattered my ankle upon landing. This put me in hospital for 3 weeks on morphine, tramadol and endones in 2 hour cycles. I then got back into my old habits quick smart as I couldn't quite do anything else with my life being a fucking cripple.
In August I had suicidal thoughts and tendencies, these lasted till November (this was during therapy where I really opened up for the first time about my childhood and teenage years which really hurt).

I stopped therapy in November when I was advised I should visit a mental hospital as I needed more help then what I had. This for me was a wake up as I never thought I would need to do this and knew I'd look down upon myself for it, so I snapped out of my fuck... temporarily. Christmas it all came back, the self hatrid, the depression. And marijuana masked it every fucking time. I was playing games online and made some friends interstate who were bushdoofers who said something that I haven't heard anyone ever say or read anywhere. And I want to share it with anyone struggling as it helps me realize what's real and what's not.

Drugs hug you in the process addiction.

I guess it's been said before in different terms but to use the term hug, makes sense. It made me feel like everything was cool and going to get better on its own but it doesn't, for me I realized it basically made me feel like I put my life on hold (I have worked full time from 17 in mostly corporate gigs).

Fast track to January 2020, I quit  can't run, I can't do the physical things I used to do to escape this addiction (or what I used to call a bad habit). But I'm trying, I'm walking everyday, but it's just not stimulating enough, I've thought about cycling but I currently can't come up with $ for a road bike but hopefully will soon.

I'm just struggling to replace the ""hobby"" of smoking weed anytime I'm not at work. Any tips? The reason I feel like this time I will quit if I can keep distracting myself early on during this first week is the anxiety that came with smoking for the first time the last 3 months.

I've also been having super fucked up horror themed dreams and am tossing and turning most nights. Is this normal?

174,addiction,2020/01/09,"Any advice is greatly appreciated. I'm going to try and keep a long story short as best I can.
So for the past few years I've gained a very intense relationship with drugs. I've done almost all of the usual drugs minus meth/heroin.
I gained a particular interest in coke.
(Shitty friends + shitty abusive relationship with an addict played a part in speeding up that process.) 

I'll be clean from coke for almost a year in a few days.
(I stick to only natural substances now, aka, weed and psychedelics, the occasional time)

I'm here to ask for any advice I guess, see on the day of my year anniversary I'll be in the city with friends going to a gig we've been planning for almost a year now.

The problem is I know these friends will have coke an I feel myself being on the verge of a relapse.
For context, I have been out with these friends before when they have been on coke. And they have ALWAYS been very respectful and conscious of me seeing it. They'll normally head to a bathroom to keep it out of sight.

The thing that is keeping me up at night the past few nights is, while we're in the city, we'll be staying in a rented apartment for the one night.
This apartment is a few hundred yards from a house I was assaulted in and I'm terrified it will send me off the rails.
I haven't been to that area since the assault 2 years ago.

Personally I thought I was in a much better head space to deal with these types of issues. I try to take these events as  they come and try to forgive and grow from it. but since I realised two days ago where we'll be spending the night I haven't been able to sleep properly.

Normally it would be a pure validated excuse for me to go off the rails and relapse but I'm afraid of the significance that one night will have with the rest of my sanity.


Before anything is said about these friends I was the one that said it is okay for them to do is as long as I don't see it. I know what I can handle and know to leave the party when it gets too much. And they have no where near any addiction to coke, one of them can't even finish half a gram in one night. I know they would never allow me to have some but I know I can find it if I really want to. And I do.
This will be the toughest one yet and no matter if I get a bag or not it will be messy.

I guess what I'm asking if there's anyone who has had a similar issue and if they can give me any advice.

182,addiction,2020/01/10,"It started with one hit I (22f) never imagined myself even trying weed. I grew up in a conservative and religious small town. I had a lot of presumptions about the drug. But then my friends were in the car and one of them took out a pen. It happened slowly. I tried it once and was fine without it for months. My first experience was very positive. I had a lot of fun with my friends and never felt more happy and at peace with the world. Then I tried it a few more times. Then somehow I ended up buying some. But I rarely touched it at first. Maybe once or twice a month. Slowly I just kept doing it more and more often.  During the summer 2019 I attempted suicide and began smoking on a daily basis to cope with the depression. Every night I slept feeling disgusting and every morning I woke up feeling disgusting. I started to notice wrinkles on my face. 

My younger brother (19) said he could tell when I was high because I wasn’t angry. It made me realize what I was hiding underneath. I thought I was helping myself by using weed to deal with my anger and sadness. The truth is whenever I let myself get sober the baggage was still there. 

Once the school semester began I thought I would slow down. But I didn’t. I began smoking earlier and earlier in the day. I was high in class. I was high in lab. I’d go to my car and smoke in between classes. My voice began to sound raspy and I did poorly in school. It was my last semester in undergrad and I spent it faded as hell. I tried going to therapy, but I thought my habit was more effective treatment lol. 

I kept going until I couldn’t anymore. I smoked and took 30mg edibles a day and barely felt any difference. It would take more and more and more weed to feel baseline moods. I don’t blame the marijuana to be honest, I was clearly trying to run away from the reality of my life. 

I spent hundreds on it. Money I could have used to help others. It could have contributed to my tuition. I could have paid for new tires for my dads car. I could have bought my brother the laptop he always wanted. I could have invested it into the stock market. But no, I threw it away on poison. 

I don’t know what damage it’s done to my body at this point. But the daily use for the past six months has been affecting my conscious. My family is against weed and I know if they caught me I’d be in trouble. For so long I just said I’d never get caught, but the guilt and stress of hiding it made me feel more shitty. 

I’m writing all of this now to warn people. Look if you’re a vulnerable person like me it isn’t a good idea to just try things once. I couldn’t have been more against weed to begin with. It’s funny because my friends didn’t even pressure me to try it, I just let my curiosity take over. 

It has officially been two days without smoking and I unadded my dealer on all social media. I’ve tried to quit before, but this time it is so much different. I don’t want weed anymore.

My best friend of 4 years has had a rocky past when it comes to life in general, she has major rapid cycling depression which she always stays on top of (she has some of the best health coverage due to her moms occupation so she gets a lot of help managing her illness which she takes 100 percent advantage of something I am proud of her for because ive known many with the same bipolar disorder who didnt manage it at all or self managed in some way) anyways she told me once a long time ago that when she was in highschool she started smoking heroin, she said she got clean and only time she slipped up was one time and she realised why and stopped. Okay so fast forward 2 years (we had a big fight and we weren't talking for about a year) she came into my boyfriends work one night with her 45 year old boyfriend (she is 25 this year) she had been trying to contact me but I had her blocked and friends on automatic response when she asked to say they didnt know. She came in to try and get him to talk to me amd convince me to listen to what she had to say. He texts me and tells me she is at his work and i blow it off, then he gets home and we start talking about it and he says ""you should have seen her, she didn't look good she is frail, thin, has major bags under her eyes, and just all around seems to not be in a good place"" she has never been overweight but id say she was a healthy plump, with curves and everything that comes with, but she was wearing her 12 year old sisters pants because she was so thin. I took the next week deciding weather to contact her and ended on deciding I needed to make sure she was okay. I was worried if anything it could be an eating disorder since I know she was always complaining that she needed to lose weight even though she was beautiful and really didn't need to lose any. I'm rambling but this was about 4 months ago and now I'm noticing her current living situation is people with enough money to spend on things like prescription opiates which one of them has been frequently supplying her she says ""its no biggie cos if I wanted I could go and ask for them to perscribe it because its used for bipolar"" which seems good on the surface but knowing that she never pays for Dr visits or prescriptions or even her gas (gets a gas card supplied by her boss to fill her tank) why wouldn't she just go and get her own prescription? Then she starts talking about how she has to stop smoking weed so shes excited to start using sssyrup instead she says ""its like purple drank and I LOVE purple drank have you ever tried it?"" I said no and I repeated what i have told her before that I don't put that kind of stuff in my body because I don't like the risk of addiction she blew it off saying that it was good and that her roommates have it all the time and have been sharing it with her. I don't know if I'm being crazy or not here but it seems to me if she isnt already back in the clutches of a dangerous addiction she is heading straight there.

193,addiction,2020/01/11,"What to do outside? This is a stupid question...but what activities can I do outside?

My whole teenage years was video games, for hours, everyday. The reason I am stopping now is I believe I've done some hearing damage from headphones. 

Also had some bad experiences in my first year of middle school. Ever since then I became a hermit and played games until high school graduation.

Honestly, the only thing I regret was not knowing the hearing loss damage or other possible influences (when I play games, people mistake me a a 14 year old, when I am 19. Possible lack of testosterone through devslopment due to being sedentary?) Otherwise, I would say it was worth it. 

Got no friends also. I've been outside,and I have nothing better to do than walk. It's quite boring. No other people play basketball around me, so not like I could do sports.

I’ve been with my boyfriend almost a year now and recently found out he had been stealing my adhd medication from me for about 8 months of our relationship. Once I found out, I decided to tell his parents. We separated for about a week but eventually decided to work things out. He promised to get clean, however he still smokes weed every single day. I know he shouldn’t even be doing that, but he has severe depression and social anxiety and it seems to help him out (except sometimes I wish he wouldn’t abuse it as much as he does). He finally got a job and everything seems to be great, except something seems a little off. 

He works 3 days out of the week and has to be up by 3 am in order to get to work on time. These last couple of weeks I notice when he wakes up he brings his travel bag into the bathroom with him in the mornings when he is getting ready. This bag also goes with him to work because he brings extra clothes and stuff to work. I have also noticed after about 10-15 minutes of him being in the bathroom getting ready for work he starts sniffling excessively...way more than usual (he’s had a constant sinus/allergy thing that’s been lingering on for months but it seems much worse on the mornings he works and suddenly after he’s been in the bathroom for a while). 

I’ve tried checking the bag once, but I was rushed and nervous he would walk in and notice me snooping. I don’t want to be caught snooping and then be wrong about my suspicions. 

What should I do? What other signs can I be on the look out for? I hope I’m wrong, but everything in me says I’m not...especially now that he is making really good money and has the means to fund his addiction.",345,0.0,0,0.0

198,addiction,2020/01/11,"The essence of addictions All addictions boil down to the same principle: avoiding our deepest self.

In doing so we are avoiding pain, especially emotional pain. Indeed as emotional pain magnifies physical pain, the latter would be handled, accepted and eventually treated if we were in a state of pure consciousness: just raw presence without any reactions. So healing the root of emotional pain is the key. 

The universal solution is thus:  deeply facing ourselves. This entails facing our emotional pain with the power of Love and meditative presence.

The most important point to understand here is that our deepest self is immensely intelligent and beautiful, there is nothing to fear: even our pain is the expression of a very deep and beautiful intelligence, the embodiment of the Divine itself.

  We are scared of our darkness because we believe it is evil but in truth these hide the most stunning jewel in the universe: our true heart. 

We also have to understand that meditative pure presence itself is a miraculous medicine of the highest kind: when it is applied to emotional pain it will magically transmute it into bliss. That's right the truth is an alchemical one: transmuting darkness into light. This means that pain cannot be disgarded, it is an innate part of yourself and with knowledge it becomes the precious raw fuel that will get transformed into pure blissful love. 

In the end it was all about sitting with ourselves, with no distractions in the presence of Love. But in this modern world everyone is afraid to do that, even regular people who don't use drugs. All our life we are running away of ourselves with hyperactivity: jobs, drugs, hobbies, distractions, etc...

It may sound like a fairytale but this enlightened higher love is real. Many sages and masters have praised it since ancient times.

Now shamanic plant medicines are also showing us that this shadow work was the real key all along.  

For instance Iboga, the miracle plant that cures heavy addictions.  I have taken it...not for addictions but for emotional pain. It put me through very hard work, but I patiently carried on until the end because I knew that there was something beautiful on the other side of all this darkness I needed to face.

Darkness can be faced progressively in your day to day life or in an accelerated way through shadow work and plant medicines. Our choice.

203,addiction,2020/01/11,"Going to rehab...scared. Well, my addiction began innocent and without me even knowing im addicted with weed. Then it progressed to MDMA and pills... then benzos.

Benzodiazepines are what almost killed me, and I got hooked on them after 1 Xanax. That’s the power of addiction when you have mental health problems. Then cocaine came along... that was fun, going pub every weekend with the lads, doing bumps in the toilets and then believing you’re O’Sullivan when playing pool.

How did heroin get into my life? I’ve got no clue... well... that’s a lie. I know exactly how, but I never used it at first just been around it too much, to a point where I couldn’t go a day without being around heroin. That’s when I started snorting it (I’m not a fan of needles or smoking brown dust).

So, here I am now. Almost died 3 times, and apparently I was brought back once which I still refuse to believe because the doctors were reluctant to say as they only treated me after a stranger did CPR on me because I had a seizure and then dropped still on the floor. But let’s not get into that.

It’s Saturday 2am, I’m in the U.K. and on Monday the 13th I am admitting myself into an addiction and mental health hospital for a month long program. I am scared, shitless. 

I’ve been crying almost non stop for the past few days, because the true and normal me is fighting the addicted me. Drugs have been my coping mechanism since I was 15, and before that I didn’t have a coping mechanism. I want to go, get help, get healthy, come back to my family, get back to work, find myself the one, which was the one every time while I was using drugs, until all of my relationships ended because 2 toxic people may relate, but won’t work as a couple.

I would just like to say to anybody else who has been battling addiction for any amount of time: please don’t be afraid to seek help. Once you seek help, that’s when the scary part starts but guess what, you CAN get through it. Many people have, even those who didn’t want to and people say you can only recover from addiction if you want to. 

You don’t need to want to, you just have to come to a point in life where you realise drugs aren’t the problem, addiction is. Drugs just tend to bring the illness to people, but addiction is the devil, not the drug.

I wish everyone the very best in life, and I will post an update once I’m back in a month. Feel free to message me, ask me anything, or if you just need to talk I am happy to talk. 

P.s: During addiction treatment they take away your phone, because you need to focus on nothing and nobody else but yourself.

Treatment is very expensive, I am blessed to have a loving family with amazing insurance who insured me and helped me make the first steps, but the last steps are hardest. Getting to the centre is going to be hard, but once I’m in, I’m in.

206,addiction,2020/01/12,"Locked fiance's computer... Help! I hope you can give me some ideas/perspective. I just don't know what else to do anymore. I (F 35) am pregnant (33 weeks), we are getting married in 3 weeks and moving into our first house in 4 weeks. Since Christmas I've been in terrible pain and can hardly walk due to some medical issues with the pregnancy. I knew already that everything would be a bit too much with the wedding and the move but at least the pregnancy was okay until recently. My fiance (M 36) has had a gaming problem for quite a few years (we've been together 3 years, it was already bad when we started). He usually plays at least 6 hours each day and up to 14 hours. He has been trying to finish his MA degree for 6 years (only the thesis is left, this is possible where we live). He used to work a bit (just enough to barely support himself) but in April I offered to pay for all our expenses so he could concentrate on and finish his thesis. He has completed one big paper which was the only other requirement so the thesis is the only thing left. We moved in together a year and a half ago and are excited for this baby (it was planned, it is his first and my third (I have two kids from my previous marriage)). I do understand that his inability to finish his degree is paralyzing him (but he has made a lot of progress this past year) and I understand that baby, first house, marriage is a lot. But I can't take any more gaming. I work full time, I take care of my older kids, the pregnancy issues are driving me insane and I am organizing the whole wedding and move by myself. Today I made him promise to focus on his work and not spend all day gaming while I kept packing etc.  I checked in on him every hour or so (to ask if he was hungry, to cuddle a bit, to ask him to help carry up a box) and all he did was play video games. After 6 hours I told him in a nice way that I am about to lose it. We have talked so many times about gaming less and I tried to support him/ yell / cry / try to show interest / ignore it... nothing has ever worked. He then went to sleep for two hours because this stressed him out too much. When I woke him up I told him I was scared to marry and have a baby with a gaming addict and that we need to work this out. I asked him what we should do and suggested we put the computer stuff and the play station away for a few days so he could either help with the packing or focus on his thesis (I know that is hard to do without a computer but maybe he could go to a library or something). Since I am gone most of the day that was the only idea I had to keep him from gaming. He still has his phone on which he can play but I hope it is not quite as entertaining. He thinks all of this is ridiculous and has left the house to go on a walk an hour ago. So here we are and I hope you have some insights on what I should do. I will not break up with him. I really really love him and he is a wonderful, smart, caring and great guy apart from this gaming addiction. I know I sound absolutely stupid and enabling etc. I have told him quite often that I would post on reddit and he said you would all say to ""drop that zero and get a hero"" but I really want to make this work. I believe in him and in our relationship and I think we can work this out, I just need some ideas on how to do that. I don't have any addictions and I never play video games so I just don't know how to help him limit it or if it needs to be cold turkey. He says he is so stressed out about this thesis that he has been playing video games to calm him down. But it's been SIX YEARS and he is super smart , a great writer and will get an A on it for sure. And he is almost finished. He has thought about just quitting but after all that money that we put into it and all the fights and worries etc., I would feel so horrible if he quit right at the finish line. Especially since I don't think it is just the thesis. What happens if he gives up and then just keeps playing video games 24/7. There is enough other stuff in our lives to keep stressing him so I think he needs to quit gaming before being able to help with the baby etc. So my questions are: Is it ridiculous/mean/controlling to lock his laptop and some equipment from his PC so he can't use it? What else can I do to help him? How do we proceed from here?",898,0.0,0,0.0

It started out with I’d get drunk and say something stupid or embarrassing but then it’s like I learned to control it to a point where little things would tick me off and I would go on a full rage texting her and saying mean and diminishing things to her, she put up with me until the beginning of college. I had cheated on her and  every time i messed up I would feel like shit the next day and the days that follow because Democrats the guilt, but my problem was to deal with that I’d drink again, causing more problems again. After she dumped me I stayed away from booze and went to the gym more and felt better about myself. Then I met a new girl who I liked but didn’t wanna date date if you know what I mean, she was really sweet and I liked hanging out with her. I missed just that connection and being able to lay In bed with someone and just talk or watch movies or just hold. Then it started again, one night while drinking with my friends I wanted her to come back over but it was very late and she couldn’t so I said mean stuff and I said stuff like oh I’ll have my ex back any day now and lots of just mean embarrassing things. We talked the next day I told her about my problems and that it wouldn’t happen again because I want to change and she believed me, the other night after that I drank again and hit up her best friend (yes I know very STUOID) but I did and she didn’t find out tell the next day, anyway she found out and said I’m a liar and I took advantage of her trust and forgiveness and it really shook me because I remember that I promised I wouldn’t let that happen again and then I drank and did it again.

I quit weed for the first time about 50 days ago, because that was the cheapest stuff I could get to dull my emotions but it worked pretty well.  The following weeks have been absolutely hell.  I told myself that since I’m quitting weed (the thing I have the biggest problem with I still think about it all day every day) It’s okay for me to do kratom/armodafinil/adderall/alcohol/DXM/literally anything else I can get since those things don’t really fuck me up as much and I don’t revolve my life around them and I’m cycling between substances.

I hate just having to stay alive being unbearably miserable and utterly alone, but I don’t know what else to do.

Like i’ve just been hit by a bus.  Life is so unbearable, and drugs are the only thing that give me one fucking second of peace.  I guess I just need to know, is it possible that the drugs in the end are causing this?  Maybe it’s not depression and anxiety, but instead the “withdrawal” from not having that dopamine/serotonin boost.  I’m scared to just quit because I don’t think I can live like this.  I have nobody to help me, my family and friends don’t understand.  Also, quitting drugs will make me super unpopular since everyone in high school does it.

Literally and just sat down in the chair in front of me with this big shit grin on his face saying ""That'll make you feel better"". Heart was racing at this point and I was googling what it was, etc because I was a couple months new to meds being on Welbutrin at that point. I decided to start small, take a quarter. Meh...Couple hours passed and I felt better...thought nothing of it except where do I keep the rest of this?

That was really my first ""stimulant"" use, I never felt anything before besides being drunk out of my mind a few times. So it was kinda exciting I could take a pill, get a little effect and just keep on living like nothing?

I've been self-medicating with over counter codeine (Solpadeine) since I had open heart surgery in 2003 aged 16. They helped with the PTSD I was left with after such invasive surgery. Depression and anxiety followed and took over my life. I met my partner in 2009 and we married in 2016. My use since then had become an addiction which I never shared fully and I have been heavily taking them for I would say the last two years.

We sadly suffered a miscarriage last year following 3 years on a fertility program. My wife has had enough of the anger and mood swings which the drugs leave me with and has said her love for me has changed. In an attempt to get honest at last I told her the truth what I was abusing myself with and I have for the last 3 days been back living with my Mum to give her some space.

I've not dealt with the miscarriage and we have not had face to conversation about it and the grief and loss we have experienced and how we have changed.

I deeply love my wife and the contact since I left has been her feelings have changed and I should not hold onto any hope of a reconciliation.

She did visit my GP with me on Saturday where it all came out and I start addiction therapy tomorrow where I hope I can also explore other aspects of my mental health. My desire for change to become the person she fell in love with is so strong and I just pray for her to see this and help me on my journey.

I know she is so angry at me but I can't see a future with her in. I'm not sure what I hope to achieve with this ramble of thoughts but I need to put it out there for comments and the hope I desperately need that others have survived such things.

242,addiction,2020/01/14,"First time poster. New to Reddit. Struggling with two addictions. Losing all hope. Hi. I'm new here. This is going to be long.  
I'm currently struggling with a Binge Eating Disorder and an addiction to fizzy juice.   
But addiction/disorders are nothing new to me. At age 10 I was diagnosed with Trichtotillomania. I ended up with three bad patches on my head. I managed to stop somehow, but to this day if I get my hands on a pair of tweezers I will lose hours to pulling out leg and arm hair. Later on in life, I was addicted to alcohol. I drank to black out every night. In the house, on my own. I'd wake up still drunk and just start again. I went cold turkey and now I've been sober for five years. I've been taking anti-depressants on and off since I was 16/17.  
I am now 25. I first developed the binge eating disorder when I was 15. I did actually seek professional help for it when I was 17, but it didn't seem to be taken too seriously. I saw a shrink once every two weeks who did nothing except ask if I'd filled in my food diary and then talk about me moving away from this town. It was.. odd. I stopped going. Over the years I have successfully had periods of time where I have succeeded in stopping. Lost weight. But then it always comes back with a vengeance. I currently weight two stone more than I should for my height/frame. It really should be a lot more than that, but I have a dog I walk three times a day and I am on my feet for my part time job, which helps keep the weight off a little. But not enough.   
Usually that would be my biggest worry, but just now it's the fizzy juice. I am drinking two to two and a half litres a day (along with the food binging) and I just cannot stop. Nothing is stopping me. Not the fact none of my clothes fit. Not the fact my work uniform barely fits. None of the health risks and dangers. Not the fact a guy drank three litres a day and *died*. Absolutely nothing. I need to stop but I don't know how. I go to sleep and wake up raring to go. I'm going to be better today! But it's like something in my brain switches and before I know it I'm off to the shops to buy myself some. I honestly found quitting alcohol easier than this. Has anyone else here gone through it?  
I feel a bit bad posting this, since most people here are talking drug/alcohol issues.   
It's like there has always been a void inside of me that constantly needs filled with something. I can't remember a day since I was about ten years old where I wasn't dealing with at least one addiction/disorder.  
I don't remember a different kind of life. But I want one. So badly.

249,addiction,2020/01/14,"2 Years trying to be clean. Now 24 days clean :) Thoughts and lessons about the process About two years ago I said to my self that I am addicted. That's a huge first step to begin with, after that I've tried many times to be clean from porn, alcohol, gambling and other stuff. I find myself with a compulsive/addictive personality. I not heavily addicted to any of this things, but I always struggle to quit them. I used to watch porn daily for the last 10 years at least and I've been drinking for about the same period. Btw, I'm 24 now.

As I say in the title, I've trying to be clean in the last two years. I'd say that porn is my biggest issue, but every time I tried to quit, I'd abuse alcohol, internet surfing or something like this. I am 24 days clean now, but even though I relapsed many times, I've made a huge progress. That's something I want to scream \*When you relapse, you don't lose all your progress\*. 

I see a lot of people quitting things cold turkey. I tried that, but was way harder for me. What I did for drink less was never to buy drinks in my house and when I buy drinks I only buy beer (which prevents me to be too drunk). Gambling, I can only play poker, which I can earn money or at least keep me playing for hours with little money. About porn I had to stop 100%. I tried to only watch soft porn, see images or something like that but that trigger me so hard that I couldn't help my self after the first 10 seconds. 

One thing that I didn't paying enough attention in the begging was my triggers. Every time I am home alone or I am using my mobile at the toilet I want to see porn. Thus, I don't bring my phone to my toilet and if I have a stressful day or I having anxiety problems I don't let myself to be alone at home. Avoid your triggers is so much easier to avoid the urge after you are triggered!

Another find that I've recent find out. Sometimes people like me have a deep problem and addiction is just a symptom. Also, the way you see yourself makes a lot of difference. If you find yourself worthless you can do a lot of shit to yourself. But let me tell you something, you are not worthless at all!

250,addiction,2020/01/14,"What to do when caught in the cycle of drug addition, yet again, but not for the “normal” “typical” reasons one usually uses SO I’ve been a user of meth consistently, for about 10 months now then on and off 1  1/2 years before that. I snort up to 2-3 little lines a day. I also take kratom everyday and have been for about a year in a half now. 
I don’t use one or the other to numb myself or my emotions. 
I don’t do it to get through life bc I feel it’s difficult. 
I actually have a pretty good life. I have a really good job, as I am a work horse that dedicates everything within myself to contributing to making my business better in healthy, responsible ways. I’m like that off drugs too so it’s not that. The drugs do not interfere w my job in any negative way, in fact I work around a lot of people that I can tell are on drugs and it affects them in negative ways like someone always having to compensate because of it or their dependability becomes almost non existent. I am reliable, dependable, and work within the parameters of getting the job done correctly and efficiently. I have an incredible person I share my life with. We’ve been living together for almost a year now and we live in a beautiful beach town in a condo on the beach. Might I add that we work together as well. Him and I are basically a consult team for restaurants in need of help and we work very well together. He doesn’t know I do this stuff. Infact, nobody knows I do it except the person I get it from. I am a VERY VERY private drug addict and I truly only use this stuff to create maybe a little “get up and go” for me when it’s time to clean the condo as I’ve always associated drugs with cleaning it’s one of my FAVORITEST things to do and I also use it to curb my appetite bc if I eat throughout the day, I will become lethargic and lazy and I got shit to do. Plus when I eat more than I do now I gain 20-25lbs and I’m really not meant to be at that kind of weight so, when my appetite is curbed it truly keeps me at a healthy weight, not feeling uncomfortable with that tire around my body. 

I don’t look anorexic I don’t “tweak” out and pick at my skin or have any other “tweak” habits. I eat at night pretty healthy eats and I legitimately also sleep every single night. 
This stuff makes me so normal that NO ONE suspects ANYTHING not even my boyfriend who is around me most of everyday. It’s not something I’m proud of in any sense so please don’t think that, I just use it in such an “innocent” manner that I don’t feel guilty that I have this secret. I have severe ADHD (yes, as an adult) and this stuff mellows me out and helps me concentrate as well and I’m actually very high strung off of it. 

I take care of myself, I bathe, I brush my teeth multiple times a day. I even, every two days or so, clean my nostrils w q tips and hydrogen peroxide. I am so “ on pointly normal” w this stuff it’s scary. 3 years ago, I spent the previous decade in a downward spiral of depression and drug addiction as I was addicted to opiates then eventually shooting up heroin. I was so lost and miserable that I relied on drugs to cope and deal with life until I slowly but surely lost every single thing I had. I ended up waking up right before it was too late, and got help and sober. I had loved life sober and only started dabbling eventually w meth to help w my ADHD, curbing my appetite, and making things like cleaning the house fun. That self destructive life I lived before is not appealing in any way that would have me go down that road again of using other drugs. I am comfortable w myself. I’m happy w myself. I love and accept myself and have a beautiful perspective on life that I truly don’t feel i could go down that path again despite using the small amounts of ice that I currently am now.
So, my question to you is, how do I get off it when i use it in like, the most innocent “healthiest” type of way? I want off this stuff!! I do 2-3 little lines day and I also take kratom. I barely take enough of this stuff to have withdrawals But I do and it’s NOT the just “eating and sleeping for a couple days” type withdrawals, I sleep on this stuff legitimately every night and when I don’t use it will actually mess with me sleeping BUT it’s also like there is other stuff in meth now bc every time I try to stop I have like very light, yet uncomfortable “opiate” type like withdrawals and I CANNOT tolerate feeling shitty in any sense I have such a busy life, I have to keep moving..And please, people, keep in mind that I have no reason to lie or fabricate anything I’ve said here nor am I in denial. I’m looking for honest, real results in asking y’all how I kick this, that I’ve given you guys the absolute truth. 
I have big important things coming up that I cannot afford to possibly have any illegal substance within my body. 

I HAVE TO AND NEED TO DO THIS ON MY OWN I KNOW FOR A FACT I CAN
just askin y’all if you have any tips bc this is not a typical “addiction” situation but, I acknowledge that it is an addiction nonetheless

251,addiction,2020/01/15,"Sex addiction relapse. Feeling desperate and low. Please help. Need help, relapsed, feeling extremely low.

It had been almost 5 months since I acted out. I have been with my partner for 2 years. I have relapsed twice and told him about them. I’ve gone to meetings, and go to therapy bi-weekly. We hit a rough patch recently and had a big fight tonight. I feel very hopeless, scared, and alone. 

I went for a drive, and someone I know asked me what I was up to. He said he was free if I wanted to hang out and catch up. So I went, even though I knew it was not a good idea. When I got there, we talked, and then he started coming on to me and I didn’t stop it. We fooled around but didn’t have sex or kiss. I left shortly after and felt like absolute garbage. 

I got home crying and my partner asked me what was wrong, I felt so incredibly guilty and told him that I went over to someone else’s place with the intentions of talking. I told him that the other guy showed interest and made sexual advances on me. He asked if I kissed him and I said no, and he asked if we had sex and I said no. Which are true, but I didn’t tell him the touching we did. 

He’s very upset and keeps saying “how many more times is this going to happen?” To which I don’t know how to answer, because I wish it would never happen again. I feel very hopeless and worthless and like I will never be able to change this. I want to be with him for the rest of my life, and I keep messing up like this. I guess this is my last resort. I’m feeling so bad tonight I have no clue how I will be able to sleep or look at  myself.

252,addiction,2020/01/15,"Having a rough day today. I don't know if this is the place to post, but I'm really struggling today so hopefully I can get some encouragement. 

I used to be a meth addict. It pretty much developed from my being ADHD and being on meds since I was a kid.  Ritalin, then Adderall every day. Then twice a day. Then three times. Eventually I found myself an adult, a mom, and the meds weren't working anymore. I started abusing my adderall. When that ran out, I started using meth. I rationalized it in my head, telling myself I was prescribed what was essentially ""government meth"" my whole life. 

I was a functional addict for a while. I held a job. I was a good mother to my kids. I rationalized that I was a better mother on the shit, because I had the energy to play with them, and the motivation to keep the house clean and cook good meals. 

Of course... It spun out of control. I lost jobs, houses, cars. Every belonging I ever had, gone. Lost custody of my kids to my parents. Did things I'm not proud of.  Ended up in jail. 

I've been clean now a little over 4 years. And I'm doing great. Good job. Have my kids back. Sometimes I beat myself up over my past, but I'm determined to make up for it. 

I haven't had any desire whatsoever to do meth for years. Every now and again the thought enters my mind, and I shut it down with reminders of who I was on that shit. All I lost on that shit. How I destroyed my life and hurt all the people that love me. 

But today. Today is a hard one. I haven't had a day off in a few weeks. My house is a disaster. I've got piles of laundry. My sister in law is flying in to stay with us for a few days and I've got to get this place clean. 

And I'm so overwhelmed. 

I'm still living with ADHD. And unmedicated. I'm too scared to take meds again, worried I'll let it get out of control. Again. 

My favorite thing in the world used to be to get wired and clean. I loved it. I was good at it. If I had some Adderall or a 20 of ice I'd be good to go. 

I'm determined not to do it. I'm determined to stay clean.

My boyfriend relapsed on cocaine that turned into a three day binge, during these past three days he has lied to me nonstop. This relapse has cause him to be hospitalised at the semi-intensive care section because of the amount of sedatives they need to use.

It isn’t something new as this has happened in periods during our entire relationship (we have been together for about a year and a half). However, it’s only the second time he’s been hospitalised due to a relapse during our relationship. But as far as I know, the total count of him being hospitalised because of his addiction is over 10 times, the lengths of the stays has been variant.

The reason I’m considering waiting to visit him to the after tomorrow, is because he’s going to rehab for three months and that means I’m going to stay in his apartment (I used to live there with him, but due to making our relationship healthier I’m living with my grandparents till I find my own place and only spend my weekends with him) taking care of our cat that current lives there. I don’t have any friends in that town, I pretty much only know my in-laws. I’m trying to prepare myself for lonely months, I was informed it was going to be a three months stay a few hours before he was taken to the hospital because of his mental state. He will be leaving Tuesday for rehab which is also sooner that excepted.

I’m really conflicted about whether I should visit him tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. He will be sleeping pretty much all day for the next few days and not remembering much (if pretty much everything) as long as he’s sedated.  
I’m conflicted because; I’ll like to have one more day with my beloved and wonderful grandparents because I won’t be able to visit them very often and I’d like to not rush packing the things I need But it’s also my duty to be there for him and support him when going through this...

I wish it wasn't me who was writing this.  I really wish it wasn't.  I wish I wasn't handpicked because I have one of the ""best handles"" on this subject.  I wish I wasn't ""qualified"" to speak on the heroin epidemic that is a growing problem nationwide.  I wish I wasn't a member of a community no one really wants to be a part of.  No one ever says to themselves while reading stuff like mine, ""I wish I could relate to this.""

But I am.  I am the non-addict who knows all too well what it's like to have an addict in the family.

I know what it's like to worry yourself sick.  To cry yourself to sleep.  To stare at baby pictures &amp; reminisce.  To check on them while they sleep to make sure they are still breathing.

I know to watch out for pinhole pupils and subtle changes in behavior.  To listen to them talk and make excuses and pile on lie after lie.  I know what it's like to pretend to believe them because you are just too mentally exhausted for an argument when you know they are lying straight to your face.

I know what it's like to be confused all the damn time; to see their potential, to know what they are throwing away.

I know what it's like to want their recovery more than they do.  To be the one doing research on rehabs and other outlets for recovery.

I know what it's like to miss someone who is still standing right in front of you.

I know what it's like to wonder if each unexpected phone call is ""the"" phone call.  I know what it's like to be hurt so bad and be made so sick that part of you wishes you would just get ""the"" phone call if nothing is going to change.  You want that finality.  You need the cycle to end.  I know what it's like to hate yourself for even allowing yourself to find relief in that horrible thought.

I know what it's like to get the worst news of your life, and still walk into the grocery store and run your errands and smile at the cashier.

I know what it's like to become a part-time detective.  To snoop through drawers and texts.  You know you are going to find something, and you look until you do just so you feel less crazy.  So you can say to yourself, ""I am not paranoid.  This is happening again.""

I know what it's like to have your mind clouded; to turn into a functioning zombie.  I know what it's like to be physically present at board meetings and dinner dates, but mentally gone.

I know what it's like to stop caring about your own personal and professional life.  My relationship took a backseat, Christ not even the backseat - I kicked him out of the car.  I would show up to work not showered and with huge bags under my eyes.  I would cry at my desk.

Everything the outside world expected of me seemed frivolous if I couldn't keep one of my most important people in my life out of harm's way.

I know what it's like to be really pissed off.  Like, REALLY pissed the hell off.  Between the sadness there is a lot of anger.  I know what it's like to feel guilty for being so mad, even knowing all you know about addiction.  You are allowed to be angry.  This is not the life you signed up for.

I know what it's like to scour a bookshelf and not find what you are looking for because this illness is still so hard to talk about, let alone right write about.

I know what it's like to hear someone argue that addiction is not an illness, that it is a choice.  I know all too well that feeling of heat rising in your face as they go on and on about something they know nothing about.

I know what it's like to stop becoming angry with these people.  They do not understand.  They are lucky to not understand.  I know what it is like to catch yourself wishing that you didn't understand either.

I know the difference between enabling and empowering.  I know there is a fine line between the two and the difference can mean life or death.  I know what it's like to the feel the weight of each day on your shoulders trying to balance the two.

I have been through enough to know that things don't just change for the worse overnight; they can change in a millisecond.  In a blink of an eye.  As quick as it takes two people to make a $10 exchange.

I know what it's like to feel stigmatized.  To be the ""sister of a drug addict,"" a ""friend of a drug addict,"" ""the daughter of a drug addict.""  I know what it feels like to be handled with kid-gloves because no one outside of your toxic bubble knows what to say to help.

I don't know what the future holds for anyone who loves an addict today.  One thing I know for sure is I am not alone.

It hasn't been easy asking for help or even knowing how to look for help, I recently had my appendix removed and I asked the nurses how to get help. They gave me a number and I called.

I contacted my health care provider, they will be covering the majority of the expenses, including laundry, food, etc. The time I miss from work and the fraction of the treatment add up a sizeable amount. An amount that will make it hard for my fiancee to pay for our house, daycare, and food for our children. If you have any advice or be willing to donate to my family, please do so. I have a GoFundMe, or if you have advice please leave a comment and share if you think there are people that could help.

The duty has fallen on me due to my siblings all having their own families while I am childless by choice. I don't mind, I have my own life outside of working and caregiving. My folks are still pretty independent but sorely need the financial and household help I bring to the table by living with them.

The problem is my nephew (23Y/O) He is an addict who has been in and out of rehabs and mental hospitals more times than I can count. He never makes it more than 8 hours after a discharge before getting high. Torching every bridge he crosses my parents are the only stable thing he has. He lives here and does nothing but cause trouble for us. His DOC is meth, without meth he will do anything he can to get fucked up, herion, pills, booze... He has drank rubbing alcohol, flavor extracts, mouthwash, in a real pinch with no fix he will go outside and huff gasoline in the garage. 

He smokes in the house with no regard for my mothers emphysema, he has stolen 1000s of dollars of money/valuables from all of us, guns, electronics, cash, anything of value ... He brings lowlife bums into the house without asking. I am fucking sick of his addictions ruining what should be my parents golden years.

I want to leave this place for my own sanity and sobriety, but without my contribution my parents will lose the house they love so much. I want to force an ultimatum of 'him or me' on them, but I refuse to further break their already torn hearts. I want my nephew to WANT to get the help he so desperately needs before it's to late, but I don't think that will happen so I want him to end up in prison rather than end up dead in a ditch because those are the only options he is giving himself.

I needed to get that off my chest for my own sake. He was discharged 2 weeks into a 90 day recommendation yesterday... My spare PC Monitor is now missing along with him while I was at work today. I was feeling a strong urge to drink because I was very angry but that feeling has subsided. Now I just feel pity for him.

So I have been addicted to internet porn since I was 12 and I am in my 20s now. I go a week maybe without porn and go back, my recent relapse was 13 days, I have been actively trying to quit over the past 3/4 years but took it more seriously last and this year.

I want to quit porn because I believe that it can have physical harms, such as to my brain, as well as causing depression, and suicide feelings. I have poor mental health, and have had it for over the past several years.

Anyways, I try to quit porn but its difficult because I don't naturally socialize often, I have been single my entire life and don't see myself dating anyone any time soon, so I go back to porn because video games and music can only do so much.

I'm trying to quit to be a decent person and happier I guess.

Still drinking all day starting at 9 AM. Total asshole and not himself.

Where he was functioning, now he doesn’t work at all nor pay his bills.

Where he would go a couple days high and a couple days down, now he goes a full week high and this time going on two weeks down.

He has lost another 30 lbs and looks emaciated.

He has isolated everyone. Lies about literally everything. Doesn’t work, doesn’t pay bills, lies through his teeth. Where he used to also drink and chew tobacco, now he seems to only use whatever drug he’s on. We can’t get any useful information from him or his wife. He is being enabled left right and centre.

To the point that he has clients calling him with no answer, some he has made pick up keys to his shop, get their deliverables themselves, and drop the keys back off while he remains comatose on the couch.

He doesn’t pay any bills yet he bought himself a brand new truck, then decked it all out, then bought new dirt bikes for his kids, etc all while never working and saying he has no money.

I found solitude in high doses of doctor prescribed benzodiazepines before ultimately overdosing resulting in my doctor ceasing the prescription. This led to the most pain I’d ever endured, the benzo withdrawals, and then deciding to stay sober. With a few months of sobriety and the pain of the aforementioned life changing event remaining unsolved I made the decision to try my cousins adderall after reading about the effects online. From the very first time taking the two blue pills (10mg tablets) I fell into an abusive love story that I have tried to separate from thrice. My final attempt at quitting lasted 6 months before convincing myself that I now contained the self control to only use on occasion. That led to using no more than twice a week, then no more than four times a week, and now I find myself fighting a horrific war everyday as I try to talk myself out of taking another, and another, and another. At its peak I was using between 200-300mg of adderall per day depending on the daily events and using over a gram of cannabis shatter a day which which resulted in an overdose before my most recent attempt to quit. Now here I stand having lost my self control again and am using between 50-80mg of Dexedrine a day and still using cannabis but significantly less frequently as I’ve found I become delusional and hallucinate when I use too much cannabis.

309,addiction,2020/01/19,"Seeking advice! To start, I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years this month. During that time, he has hidden that he has a drug problem. I knew that he would take pills/coke here and there but thought it was just sometimes and for fun. It escalated last year when he was using coke constantly and lying about it. He would wake me up every hour with all these paranoid accusations of stuff he would just make up and none of it made sense.   


He ended up going to rehab last year and to my knowledge, I thought he didn't pick it back up. Since then his dad has passed and I noticed he was acting strange again. He starting using coke &amp; pills again, and refuses to go to rehab or see a counselor. He just started a new job, and so only allows himself to do it on his days off. In doing so, he stays up all night and then when I go to work the next day he harasses me with nonsense of how I'm cheating on him, or to explain this or that, making up a lot of stuff. It's not as intense as it was last year, and my reactions are a lot different as well. I tend to just ignore him and sleep in another room. I figure if I don't participate then he will leave me alone.   


I used to have the urge to want to talk to him about this, and let him know how much it hurt me and expected an apology for how he treated me.. although it always ended in a fight and he would say to drop it and it was the drug, not him. He lies to me all the time, saying he is going to the store or a friends, and he will come back high.   


When he does go for awhile without using, he will say he needs pills instead so he doesn't end up doing coke. And I shouldn't have a problem with it since he's not using coke. If I try to push it, he says that talking about it is going to end up with him going out and getting coke if I don't stop.   


The other night he told me he thinks he would be able to quit no problem if he has a job he is passionate about and something he loves doing. Then it was brought up how if I stay with him or leave him, he's still gonna be doing this. It doesn't matter. That he would figure out what days he has our daughter and then make sure not to use it then.  


This was really a stab in the heart for me and over the past few days, I have been thinking about leaving since I feel like I cannot help this situation or him anymore. We have been through the motions of this. Anger, sadness, patience, understanding. He doesn't seem to acknowledge this is a problem at all. Idk what to do anymore. I think it's time to let go and take care of myself since he doesn't understand or care to try to know how this is hurting me. It makes me angry that he doesn't even acknowledge my feelings, yet I try so hard to be patient for him.

Today marks one year no cocaine for me and alcohol will be end of next month. If your reading this, I hope you realize that if you and I didn’t hit as low (or, maybe as low as you will keep hitting) as we did then we will never be as ‘high’ as we are now. Sure, high maybe not the best choice for an “addiction” sub well it’s meant as in high off yourself and your own self power. You have the power to control your life you just have to use it and if that requires submitting to outside help that’s okay too. To be honest , now, the thought of me actually using doesn’t scare me as much as the thought of how fast I could loose what I have created for myself. The first few months were terrifying and I felt so fragile. What has kept me sober is 1. Never forgetting or numbing out the low I felt the day I decided to get clean because I never wanna be there again and 2. How fucking amazing I feel and the drive I have to keep taking hold of my life. Now, tonight thinking to myself how fast this year of work could be gone if I let it AND how shitty it would be is a very satisfactory feeling. I have created so much space and peace for myself and it’s mortifying to think of fucking that up.

Anyways i wanted some advise on the last few years of my addiction.i got out of the last rehab 9 months ago. I went in for abusing meth and heroin, but before that i was abusing vyvanse and adderol almost everyday and was suffering when i wasn’t on it. I was addicted to these pills and then happened to get introduced to the wrong guy who i was very attracted to and he gave me meth and heroin and it went downhill until rehab. After rehab i didnt want to use meth or heroin again, but asap i was back on vyvvanse i had it as soon as i was home. Its been 9 months i relapsed a once on meth but was so disgusted by the experience (due to it being done in a bad situation), i have not touched it since. Okay anyways so now i am stuck on vyvanse i take two 50mg capsules when i work and none when i dont work sometimes i run out because i work more often than not, and usually purchase adderol when i have ran out. It’s awful and good. The days i work i usually have more energy to get me through the day and the day is usually overall better, but when i don't work its awful i cant even move im withdrawling majorly and it sucks. I don’t get anything done on my days off and when i work i feel happier than ever but when i'm off i literally want to die.

I was prescribed adderall around a year ago, and I 100 percent abused it like crazy.

Once I felt like coffee was making me feel worse about my heart health, and the fact that I would have a massive crash about 2 hours after work, I messaged my friend asking if he had any adderall. That was about 2 months ago, and since then I have been saying to myself that I will not do it again after I have used it. However, the next day I return to using it... I am not totally unproductive while using it, I keep myself busy doing homework for classes that just started, but a lot of the time I end up putting the energy that the pills give me to ""perfect"" my stream for overwatch (lol i know its a dead game).

I also feel **DEPRESSED** without this drug, like a drug addict without cocaine.

Today in the morning, I felt ""not tired"" but at the same time not very clearheaded. I work as a software developer and have to think clearheaded. But I think everyone has to have a clear head.    
Without caffeine, I feel a bit slow and have to force my brain to focus and push myself. I spent times on developing code f.e. 2 hours, I could have done in around 30 minutes if my brain synapses would fire a bit faster. 

With caffeine, and also good music and motivation BUT also when I had a good sleep the night before, I can think faster and be more productive.  **It doesn't take discipline to do stuff, because I feel like doing it automatically!** 

The way caffeine effects me is pretty heavy. One espresso can cause sweating sensations and jitteriness. One mild cup of coffee does not effect me that hard, but does have a good effect on me. 

I drank a mild cup of coffee today at around 2-3 p.m. and I still feel wide awake. Yesterday at Sunday for example **I drank no caffeine**, no tea and no coffee, and I **felt sleepy like a normal person in the evening**. (*I did nothing yesterday because I felt lethargic without caffeine*)    Today I feel like being on speed or other hard stimulant, even though I drank only one cup of coffee and a Yerba mate at work.   
I feel pretty happy and slight euphoric but also restless. I actually **feel like I took some low dose amphetamine or similar stuff**.  I did a workout 1-2 hours before (40 min cardio and many pushups) but I don't feel slightly tired. I even sweat a bit and I have to go to sleep soon. 

**THE ISSUE is that when I cannot sleep well, I feel more tired and also depressed the next day**. I also had many times I felt **pretty ill** the next day because I only slept 3-4 hours the night before **BECAUSE OF CAFFEINE**.  **I think my body cannot tolerate caffeine well and so it causes a real effect even in tiny dosages.** I am not even able to sleep when I had a black tea many hours before.

338,addiction,2020/01/20,"I have a codeine addiction and don’t know what to do. I’m 17 years old and I think I have a really bad problem with codeine.

It all started because I have a debilitating fear of pain but only in my abdomen/chest. Whenever I start to feel even slightly nauseous or sick I panic and begin to contemplate suicide because I would rather die than be ill. I had several bad experiences with abdominal pain earlier in the year which caused me to be so scared of it happening again. A few of these experiences were while using the bathroom so I have a ritual for how I use the bathroom now to prevent me from worrying that it’ll happen again. Lights off, phone out of the room, windows closed. It was the opposite when I was ill previously.

Another contributing factor is that my sister’s very ill. She has Cystic Fibrosis (she had a double lung transplant at 15, 9 years ago), Type 1 Diabetes &amp; Gastroparesis, to name a few. For my whole life I’ve always been witness to her screaming in pain, crawling along the floor or completely unconscious while we call an ambulance. We call at least 10 ambulances a year for her, I’m so used to it that I don’t really worry about her anymore, since she always comes back, no matter how bad things get. When I was young though, seeing this was difficult. My sister had always been prescribed Co-Codamol (30/500) and prolonged release Morphine. She’s become addicted to codeine and my mother has too, as my sister shares them with us since she has so many. My mother also gets her own prescription and gives me some. I’ve always taken Co-Codamol, even for minor pain, my mother would give me it as if it was just store bought paracetamol. I didn’t take it too much (only when I felt any sort of minor pain and panicked) but some time around September I suddenly began taking it way more often.

At the point I’m at now, I take 120mg of codeine and 2g of paracetamol every night. On some days it’ll be 240mg &amp; 4g, like tonight. If I don’t take it, I begin to feel ill and worry, and since that’s my biggest fear I come right back to it. I have to take it daily. I’ve been stealing my grandmother’s partner’s prescriptions since November, as she uses them but goes through them extremely slowly. I think I’ve stolen over 250 pills since November, I’m sure. Something like that. She hasn’t noticed and I’m putting it to bad memory that comes with age. I feel awful, however. I can’t keep doing this.

I just don’t want to rely on them daily anymore but I’m so scared of illness, I don’t know what to do. I see several therapists and have been doing so for a while now due to my mental health. My next appointment is in 35 hours and I was going to bring this to their attention for the first time. I’m hoping that’s the correct thing to do.

For years I have been battling my addictions, and what it feels like to me is I'm trying to fight the symptoms and not the disease. I'll go weeks or months sober, and end up backsliding again and again.

I can feel it, something beneath the surface, some sort of deep psychological dissatisfaction that I am so far..  just barely aware of, that motivates me to seek out drugs, sex, and other addictive behaviors. It's a hard feeling to put words into, because I've numbed myself for so long in regards too it, but I know there is some hidden trauma lurking beneath. I have had a rather rough childhood, but I cannot pinpoint any specific experience. Maybe there is one and I've repressed it, or maybe it's the totality of my childhoods suckery. I cannot tell.

Anyways, anyone manage to become aware of and heal their trauma? What worked for you? How did you do it? I would do therapy but I do not have the money. Anyone manage to heal themselves on their own?",195,0.0,0,0.0

362,addiction,2020/01/22,"A little confession (long) For the first time in a VERY long time I'm speaking my mind and coming clean about certain aspects of my life. I feel like this platform is the only way I can do it given the anonymity that comes with reddit. 

I live in a state where most of the calendar year is snow and the temperature is below zero. Up until this last summer of 2019 I was 3 years clean off heroin. My whole life I've been involved with some sort of debauchery or shenanigans. When I was 7 my brothers convinced me to smoke my first of many cigarettes. At 9 they handed me my first joint. At 10 I was breaking into cars and attempting to sell what I had stolen for lunch money at school, sounds like a joke, but I loved those extra slices of pizza and chocolate milk. 

At 13 after being placed into the system I started smoking weed regularly and all around not doing much. At 16 I found out the vicodin they gave me when I broke my wrist did a lot more than just make me groggy and tired. It was then I thought I found true love. 

At 17 I started smoking them. At 20 I moved to OxyContin 30, smoking two, maybe 3, one after another. I love smelling that sweet, toasted marshmallow scented smoke. At 21 I found heroin. After moving to another state with a little more freedom to experiment without feeling judged by my small community, I went all out. I think I can name more drugs I haven't tried than I have tried. I was stealing from stores like Walmart, fred meyer. Bringing product to my dealer for half price, usually getting weed, heroin and meth all at once. It caught up with me. Got stopped at Walmart with 354 dollars worth of merch and got into some legal trouble. 

I confided in a buddy of mine about my condition and he reminded me that he owed me 300 dollars and he could fly me back home and help me out. I had him book me a flight for a week later so I could hitchhike to the nearest airport and not be withdrawing the entire time. This is what convinced me to never do this drug again. It felt like my veins were itchy, the sweats, borderline convulsions because you're shivering from the bone aching cold and there's fire in your muscles, you cant move too much or you'll gag but nothing will come out because you haven't eaten anything real in probably a week. The single worst thing I've ever been through in my life.

I left the day before my flight and spent about ten hours hitchhiking going from city to city and eventually getting to the airport and finally making it home. 

After all that I vowed to never do heroin again... until about July of 2019, I relapsed hard. My wife doesn't know about it still but I did a half gram of tar in about ten minutes with the same buddy who flew me home to get away from it. I ruined three years of sobriety to try and have a good time with someone who isn't active in my life today. I still feel like shit about this and pretend to be excited when my wife brings up how long I've been sober and how proud of me she is. 

This is the first time I told a soul about this relapse and I hope there aren't anymore.

Now at 25, I have a daughter, my own place, a woman that makes me feel better than any drug possibly could. But that doesn't always fix an addiction. It still lurks over me like a vulture every day of my life but I always tell myself it isn't worth it.

368,addiction,2020/01/22,"Originally wrote this as a comment to someone else’s post but In the off chance someone can relate and needs a new perspective , I know this sub has helped me feel less horrible, hopefully this can do the same for someone else. Every person is different but maybe my own self realization can give you insight.

I was doing a lot of coke, every time the comedown was a panicked self hatred and repetitive suicidal thoughts. Like an extreme self hatred- it felt unbearable. Death always seemed less painful. I couldn’t stop- even knowing a horrible come down was inevitable. 

I told my therapist I wanted to change my pattern of behavior- to fix myself cuz I was broken and self destructive. He asked me why I hated myself, my answers were all non answers and non about my own character traits- wasn’t ready to take partial blame . They all sounded like: I don’t know who I am, life sucks, my dad hurt my mom , brother and me. My brother is a mess and I always have to fix it. My moms an alcoholic and I have to go clean her hoarded house .He told me to change the pattern I had to focus on on the feeling- not just trying to fix the behavior.  I didn’t really get it. Action and feeling felt the same. It didn’t feel like he was fixing me so I stopped seeing him.

Healthy and happy ppl mentally don’t start casually doing hard drugs, ppl hiding pain do. And if u think differently cuz you know a happy person who does drugs, how people seem is often very different from what the feel alone in secret. something in me had wanted a vice, a numbing tool, an upper, and got addicted to the high. But also addicted to the low.  Normally my self hatred for my inner self isn’t at the forefront of my mind. Body image maybe but that’s  because I am constantly seeing that. A lot of my actions I don’t really think too hard about before doing. Cuz I don’t want to feel guilt, But during the coke comedown- the self hatred was RIGHT there. Too painful, every time I tried to run from it but couldn’t and then it’s a spiral. But I never though to say ok WHY do I hate myself .

Some things I was ready to see, some I wasn’t. Nobody likes seeing their  cringy flaws. It took a lot of painful comedowns to piece together so much suppressed pain and guilt.  But it always felt like a really fucked up way to finally feel  what I hide all at once. What’s crazy, is one day, I was actually ready to look at all I had hidden straight in the face - to see myself, the version of me only I knew, that I thought was “evil”. I became self aware of why I felt the self hatred and it was 100 percent because I hadn’t been dealing with my pain and the huge (not self aware) flaws that pain caused. One of which was lying to everyone about my addiction. (The tip of the iceberg but while I know my flaws I still feel ashamed enough to not write em all out, but an example would be a pattern of taking
Full credit for a writing sample that I collaborated on in interviews- a flaw that was a direct result of not believing in my own talents)

The thing that sucks- that is exactly what therapy does, but so much gentler, so much healthier, and not addictive and crazy enough less expensive . (Mine without insurance is 150 a week- coke was 350 a week)

This is LITERALLY self medicating, and Toying with death is too. It’s knowing that no matter how much you can’t control your addiction, you have e control over ending your life. It calmed me to plan mine. 

I still struggle with my addiction to coke, cuz now it’s not self medicating - it’s a pattern my body craves, I got addicted. A consequence for doing the fix that was a wolf in sheep’s clothing( I tried to think of a better metaphor sorry )

I went back to my therapist. I know this is easier said than done. But a therapist and self medicating and two ways of coping, one just ACTUALLY helps you learn how to undo your damage. 

We all gonna die anyway, why not be less miserable? The misery becomes an addiction too. Addicted to feeling bad. Feeling bad felt normal, like home, and good felt like a stranger. But it’s a pattern I’m on the road to changing. 

This is the longest post I’ve written. And the most honest I’ve been about my addiction. A month ago I would have never said it.  Hiding and hating yourself is so so painful. And is NOT unfixable. 

Even now writing this my brain is saying don’t  post that they all gonna judge you.  They gonna think you u on a high horse or being a fake cuz you always are, always fake emotions to hide but fuck it - i think this is more

So, I'll be frank. I've always had 3 friends tops if any. Currently only my partner. All of my family is toxic and unsupportive. Even with my partner I feel alone. I feel unattractive. Untalented. And impossible of being understood by others for various reasons. I'm older (30) so making meaningful platonic relationships seems more hopeless than ever. I'm not religious, nor do I desire to be. BUT, my psychology of religion class has awakened an idea in me. Community. One of the major reasons that religious people thrive. Connecting on a level built around deep and common beliefs. 

I don't subscribe to the idea of an all powerful diety. Being bipolar, having social anxiety, and ping-ponging between anorexia and binge eating disorder further displaces me from a more meaningful existence. 

Point: Since I've been a teenager, when I liked how I looked, I've rested almost all value in myself in my skin. My ""number"" extends beyond 120 people. I'd say... at least 60 percent of which were mistakes or misguided attempts to feel complete. I'm very sex-positive but my relationship with sexuality is fractured. If that makes sense. 

Since my relationship has begun, I've moved this way of living to the web. Showing in webcam. Again I this is something I don't believe to be bad. I don't condemn myself for doing it etc. The problem lies in placing nearly all sense of SELF in the acceptance of OTHERS. It was easy when I was young, in shape, etc. I've lost those things. It was also a way to be social without hating myself. It was a way to ""hang out"" in person, and now on webcam, I still feel it's the only way to achieve being liked. Otherwise I feel like a ghost, largely ignored but unwelcome if seen. In a way, I feel like the living dead. The compliments fed me. 

I've gotta go for now, but that's the overall scenario. I know I'm not the first, nor the last external approval seeking stray, and I do have a therapist but still. I'm curious about THIS community and whether there are people who are similar.

374,addiction,2020/01/22,"Foolproof way to tell if you're a true addict Ok, I was just thinking about this and I want to know if anyone agrees. It is how I am, and this is the first time I have put it in words  but here goes...

As addicts of any kind, we play with death until it's not just a casual acquaintance to us. Many times, it becomes a friend and we beckon it. However, there's either one of two types of people when it comes to addicts and ""normal "" people. Those are the people who become revolted by their own devices and in realizing that they've been skipping alongside the grim reaper rather happily,  and those, in whom something very deeply ingrained within themselves instead rejoices in that fact and wants to bekon it a little more often and draw it a little closer.

Does this make sense to anyone? When I'm on a terror of a run, there is a part of me, or another me, or my addiction and it's end game is death and part of me isnt just cool with it, but part of me is totally down to do it. . I don't remember how that feeling started but in hindsight, I can't remember feeling any differently. JFC. What the fuck *IS* that??? Do I really hate myself that bad? Part of me says ""maybe"". I hate this whatever you want to call it. It's the only fucking thing in the world that tries to creep in at every level of consciousness including my dreams while I am sleeping. It's the only thing that'll have you throwing away all the people you love as you're suffering and selling the things you love. Or selling the people you love.  If there's anything in the world that can make a reasonably and commonly decent person fall from Grace that hard, it is fucking addiction.

I've had a real wild last 10-15 years. I'm just now, after a 2 year struggle to get clean after going out with just under 10, am actually accruing *consecutive months* outside of the confines of jail or court ordered bullshit. All I had to do was take subs and an SSRI, and leave my spouse whom I adored, 90% of my family, my home, and my life up to that point. I want to make it so fucking bad. I just want to do something in life that is good for me *and* curbs my appetite for any and everything. I just dont want to feel so empty and it's hard not to as I sort out the wreckage I caused in my life.

Part of me is still paralyzed.  I can't do the meetings and the Fucking Fellowship. I've always been a loner but I never had this much trouble letting *anyone* in. I feel like I just want to lay low and stay the fuck in this winter. Maybe I need a period of cold, quiet reflection. Maybe I'll make it to outstretch my leaves or bloom in the spring. But I do know one thing, I just gotta stay planted and not run. Just rest my neck a bit.

And, this got way longer than i meant for it to get   Oops.My bad for real

So you're a boy you live in a bad neighborhood and your poor. Your mom works all day waiting tables just so she can keep the roof that is your shity apartment above your head. And your dad he's been in prison since you were six your 15 now. You're always having to help around the house clean up feed your siblings watch them get them ready for school just the usual. Your shoes are dirty the right one has a hole in it your clothes don't look much better. You smoke weed to help deal with the stress drink once in awhile to Forget or Have fun. You never really liked being yourself you always kind of felt off. You are always anxious always had problems with anxiety and lately depression starting to show up. So one day you're at a party and someone hands you a pill it's a perk. You take it and suddenly Bang that feeling you've been searching for your whole life is there. All the feelings of warmth and love you never got as a child is here. Anxiousness anxiety depression all gone like they never even existed. You feel this one little pill has turned you into the perfect version of yourself the person you've always wanted to be. You feel calm and confident in yourself you're ready for anything you can talk to strangers pick up girls easily. That feeling you been waiting for your whole life for it's here. So slowly but surely it becomes your best friend your little helper. Anytime your family or school gets to be too much you just take half a pill and you can handle it all no problem. Even if the day is long hard depressing it's all okay because you know when you get home you have that pill. That pill will make you forget the whole day forget all the drama the anxiousness the anxiety like it was never there. So fast forward you're 18 now. the pills are getting expensive you need two or three just to get through the day and more if you want to get really high. You can't just stop this is all you know this is how it's always been since you were a kid. You never learned how to deal with and properly process your emotions and even find out why you felt the way you do. You just take a pill and there'd be no need for any of that. So now you're 23 and shooting heroin. You want to stop you really do. your little friend has turned into your worst enemy it's taking everything from you. You've tried to stop before but it just all comes back up.all that pain and anxiety the anxiousness that person you never wanted to be. It makes you sick not only mentally but physically your stomach turns your two week to keep your eyelids open you can't even get out of bed without your little friend. This makes you hate yourself you can't deal with this helpless feeling you don't know what to do. So naturally you do the only thing you know how to do the same thing you've been doing since you were 15 years old just take a pill and it will all be ok.,600,0.0,0,0.0

2011-2012: 1x Pack a week of cigarettes, Smoked 2 to 3 grams of weed per weekend.


2012-2014: 3 Cans of chewing tobacco per week, Smoked 1g of weed a day, no more cigarettes.


2014-2016: Smoking 1g of weed a day, no tobacco products.


2016 - October 2017: No more weed, 3 to 4 cans of chewing tobacco per week, and now 75 OZ of 9% beat 5 to 6 nights a week (increased to 100 OZ of 9% on weekends).


October 2017 - May 2019: No more chewing tobacco, but upped the alcohol intake. 7 days a week: weekdays 75 OZ 9% still, Weekends anywhere from 100 to 150 OZ 9%. Added in vaping liquids all day constantly (5% nicotine contents). Also went Vegan during this time in December 2018.


July 2019 - start of October 2019: 5% Nicotine still all day, NO alcohol at all (zero whatsoever). New habit - way too much Benadryl. Typically 6 to 12 (max 15) 25mg pills of Benadryl per day. 


October 2019 - beginning of December 2019: Vaping same, but cut Benadryl in half (6 max per day all taken at once in early evening). 


December 2019 - 3 days ago: 0 Benadryl, vaping same, but now taking 3g of Kratom powder in liquids per day in early evening. 



Past 3 days have been nothing except vaping still all afternoon and evening before bed. 



My major issues at the moment are ALWAYS waking up just so fucking tired no matter how much sleep I get. I have no issue actually falling asleep though. It really blows and I know this stuff I decided to do did it to me. Mentally I'm not worried about anything too much besides sleep and just always being in a state of wanting to get fucked up. The drugs and substances listed are all I've ever done. Anything harder than alcohol terrifies me and things harder than weed are things I could never ever do. 


Financially/Professionally I have no concerns because somehow none of this ruined any of that besides just hurting my pocketbook over time. I just sort of mentally and physically no longer have many feelings anymore. Barely anything brings me joy, and I just no longer physically feel life the same way I used to.

My three biggest vices have been weed, nicotine, and (embarrassingly) pornography. I call them my biggest vices because they're the only ones I use daily (the weed and nicotine being multiple times a day), and once I decide to indulge myself in one of these, there is absolutely no stopping myself till I've done it. 

I've finally accepted that I need to change.

Today is 8 days since my last cigarette (I'm using nic patches though), 2 days since I last watched porn, and about 20 hours since I've last smoked weed (probably the longest I've gone without it in months).

The patches have made quitting smoking/vaping nic not too difficult, and quitting porn hasn't been terrible, but I've been high 24/7 for months and I don't know how I'll handle giving it up.

396,addiction,2020/01/23,"How to help a family member? I don't have any brothers or sisters of my own, therefore my cousins are my closest relatives. One cousin in particular who is my age (25) is very important to me. We grew up together, went to the same school and been very close all through childhood and teenage years. However, during 20's we drifted apart due to me moving to another country and studying, and him for most part working and partying. 

In the start, I would think the partying is something he has to go through, I did party in my early ears myself and have tried numerous drugs, but it stayed at that, trying. However for the past year I am really worried about him and his substance abuse. 

Although for the most part I dont know how much he uses as we live in different countries and he is reluctant to share most details with me as he knows I would tell him to slow down and be carefull. He is in raves a lot and told me about the use of MDMA before, he goes to these raves atleast twice a month, and I guess he is not sober in any of them.

My worries started when he came to visit me about a year and a half ago, and was persistent to get cocaine when we were out in the city, and it didnt end there, he ended up using it most nights of his visit or stayed very quite/passive on the night he didnt. On top of this he was smoking weed everyday, as it is easy to get where I live. 

Last year, he told me how he took magic mushrooms and after he has quit smoking (cigarettes) and doesnt feel drawn to cocaine anymore. Instead, I am now hearing stories of him using LSD and mushrooms quite often, he is still a heavy MJ smoker and drink quite a lot. I feel like he just would do anything to just not be sober.  

I am at this point where I graduated and now am looking to start my career, and I feel like we have nothing in common. Most of the conversations he starts are either about raves, psychadelic trips and parties, and I can't really relate. 

The numerous times I have tried to approach him about this substance use, he just dismisses it or gets upset with phrases like: 'its nice you think I am a junkie' or ' whats your problem? I have a job and a place to stay'.. that context. 

I am very worried about his habits, and dont know how to deal with the situation. None of my other family are aware about this. I mean they dont even know he smokes weed( that unaware). I just feel like I need to help him before it gets worst, I feel like I am responsible in the situation because I am aware of it.

417,addiction,2020/01/24,"Can you be born with addiction? Well, let me clear things up a bit. I'm not trying to talk about addiction from a biological perspective, even though I believe it plays a really huge role in it, but I'm talking about I'll be talking about it here from a phonological prospective, and please do correct me because I'm still learning about this topic.

I'll start by telling you about my personal story with addiction, so well it's social media addiction.
First I always though that social media was stupid but yet still a cool things to have, that's just the impression I was given as a kid from people around me, however though, I believed I'd never use them and stuff but I did anyways because I though that if I didn't do so, people with think that I'm an outcast or something, so I had my Facebook account at a young age got super addicted then Instagram WhatsApp askfm and a bunch of other stuff that I don't even remember the rest of them.

Mom, as all moms are, was so concerned about that affecting my performance at school, but she didn't prevent me from doing that though because even though I was so addicted to many sites at the same time I did a pretty great job a school, and I don't know how I did so.

So years pass by then I just got done with them and figured out that maybe I'm better off without them so I just went cold turkey all at once.
Now let me break that down here : I went cold turkey from all of them but because I wanted to improve myself, it was because I though that something was wrong with social media for me, for some reason, so I just quit.

So I've been off social media for 3 years now, even though sometimes I do make Instagram/Twitter accounts for two days and then delete them again *don't really know why I do this but yeah...*
However though being all this time without it made me feel so goddamned good about myself, I felt as if I was experiencing life again, but that feeling didn't last long...

I kept questioning my descion for a long time since I even kept stalking some people even after I left so I just came into conclusion that maybe I didn't leave because I want to improve from myself, maybe I only left because I wanted people to feel as if I've disappeared, and I don't know if that sounds familiar to anyone but if yes please tell me because I just feel I'm so weird.

What's making me tell this whole story is because I've been feeling so bad lately about my reddit karma and then it hit me and I knew that I've experienced this feeling before ""social media addiction"" 
Okay so I've had a reddit account before this one and I loved it so much but just deleted the account at the time of a break down *I do this a lot by the way no idea why*
However though I really enjoyed the reddit experience on my last account and never worried at all about karma, I didn't even know what they were, however though, this all changed once a friend of mine told me about them and since then I've been so anxious about those numbers just as I was before back then and here I am back at it again and I don't like it at all...

So my question here, can addiction be something we are born with, like a genatic thing or something, or is it like a wound that will still have scars for the rest of our lives? Because I believe I'll never get over this addiction and at least I must learn to live with it and reddit is at least much beneficial than other social media platforms so that might be to my advantages, but still, I don't know so please tell me what you think about this whole thing.",710,0.0,0,0.0

Just because it has to be said, I'm a 19yo guy.

&amp;#x200B;

A little (too much, sorry) backstory to understand this better ; I am someone who takes pride in trying to be nice to everyone unless they show me they don't deserve it. So basically, I try my best to be a nice person, and **hearing about wholesome stories/videos warms my heart a lot**.

Another thing before I go on, is that it's been about 7 years since I got into video games (and watching videos on youtube) so much that I pretty much stopped studying. That doesn't mean I don't go to school, it's just that I don't do my homework or learn stuff for test, which is a problem of it's own, but that's not the topic, so please don't call me out on that.

Last thing, is that I have a lot of struggle to have any IRL social interactions, even with my friends. I am way too easily embarrassed and shy, and when I see someone else embarrassed, be that IRL, or on video, or whatever... it makes me cringe to no end sometimes. Because I relate so much that I feel like I'm the one being embarrassed...

\--

So, it's been about 2 or 3 months since I've discovered a child's show that you probably all know either from your childhood or by name, *My little pony: Friendship is Magic*.

I never watched this show (or any like it as a matter of fact), and I always thought it was just a poorly acted, cheesy show for kids. And if people like to watch this kind of things even as adult, I don't have a problem with that, but I know most people do, so I don't say it. (Which is why i'm on a secondary account btw.)

&amp;#x200B;

About half a year ago, I started watching Disney or Pixar movie animation, like the 3 Cars movie, or the 3 ""How to train your dragons"", or Zootopia, and so on. Thoses are movies that always ends well and are mostly targeted for kids, but they warm my heart a lot. And after I started to struggle to find more movies like this that I'd want to watch, I don't remember how, but ""My little pony"" eventually came to mind. I realized I never knew what it was, and I thought about watching a few episodes, just so I could make my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

And about 2 or 3 months ago.. I did just that. I watched the very first episode (which is actualy in 2 parts). I cringed a lot for reasons said before, I realised it indeed was cheesy, but when everything turned out to be fine by the end of it, it warmed my heart a little bit. And I thought, ""Well, I guess I could keep watching one more, to really make my mind"". So I watched another one. And another one.

I think I watched like 10 of them. Each one is 22 minutes long for the record.

I ended up really liking it by each episode that finished. To the point that sometimes, just thinking back to some episode can lighten my mood. And thinking about the episode I will watch later, gets me really excited.

Since then, as of 25th January ; there are 26 episodes/season, there are 9 seasons in total... and I have watched half of it all.

&amp;#x200B;

And today, I couldn't seem to do anything else. When I finished watching an episode, I reminisced on it a bit to myself, and then, I just wanted to watch the next one, and the next one. I tried to think of what else to do, but I couldn't bring myself to do something else. I watched a YouTube video or two, or played a game for like 20minutes between some episodes... but then I really felt the urge to watch another episode. Which means that... I had no time to do anything else.

As I said before, I don't personally have any sort of problem with what people like to do in their free time, but... I really feel like i'm wasting my time by doing only ONE thing of the whole day...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I really like watching that show, I really really do... But I feel like I'm wasting my time by doing only that, and I don't know how to stop this... when I try to do something else, my urge to watch it just grows stronger.

Anyone has any idea, or even just thoughts about this ?

This isn’t much of an “addiction” post, but rather the opposite. I don’t ever get withdrawals from anything. Grew up in Los Angeles, meaning lots of drugs and alcohol, so I’m no stranger to addictive substances. Middle school and high school, like everyone, was filled with pot, liquor, and experimenting with different substances at parties and what not. The difference with me is that I never got hooked on anything I ever did. I’d always believe I was addicted to cigarettes, weed, and etc... but I never got withdrawals. Throughout my life I always have occasional periods where I’d go sober for months, and sometimes up to a year. The reasoning behind that is the same every time. I either forget or become busy. Oh, I go cold turkey too... don’t feel anything. I recently started smoking cigarettes again because life was going well... and because I could. I am currently not being overwhelmed by life thankfully. I’ve been smoking kush, cigarettes, and drinking on my free time everyday after work or studies for a good 4-5 months up until two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, I wanted to see if I became hooked on anything. I’ve been sober since. I feel no physical or mental withdrawals. Now, I’m curious if this is normal, or if anyone else feels this way...

I hope this is ok to post this here. I’m just looking for more info

He “got it cleaned” but not detailed. I found a generic viagra in the dash in a shady looking plastic from a cigarette box. 


Well, I just went to the car to find something totally unrelated (he returned it 2-3 weeks ago) and I pulled up the carpet.... I could be crazy but it looked like there were little specks of crack. I want to reiterate... I’ve seen him in relapse before. I’ve dealt w this stuff. And I’m in the south.. so it’s not like it’s salt from the snow or anything. It looks weird

Then I looked under the driver side and there’s a penny, half all messed up, half normal. I remember from his relapses years ago he did something with a penny, but I don’t know what. (Maybe to break down coke/meth?)

435,addiction,2020/01/25,"What do I do about my parents meth addiction? Hello folks,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post but I'm feeling quite desperate. Since before I was born my parents have been struggling with a meth addiction, however when I was about 3 they stopped as it was impinging on their care for me (I never found out till I was 17). Ever since I have left home, I've found out that they've been taking meth on and off in my life  and ever since I left home at 18, they've openly been taking meth because they think they can ""manage it"" responsibly. Ever since I left home, they have been trying to cope with the breakdown of their own relationship as well as Empty Nest Syndrome (they believe I ran away from them even though I needed to leave for Uni. We used to be really close together as I'm an only child, I really looked up to them like my best friends). 

Now throughout my life they treated me excellently, except for one thing: if I did something wrong, they would always place me at the expectations of an adult and get ridiculously aggressive. We would have 4 hour rows about how I told a secret about someones crush in grade 5, and I was never one to put up a fight and I would listen to what my parents say, even though they continued to drum into me how awful of a person and verbally beat me down till I'm in a puddle of tears. I believe arguments like these have contributed to the reason I have massive anxiety about my character and moral upstanding today. Without my parents to judge me, I am constantly policing myself and verbally berating me in my own head to punish my action that wasn't even really that bad. Whenever they do find out something I'm doing wrong, they still use the same tactic, or instead take a passive aggressive negging approach. Since I've left, I finally thought it was time to stand up to them and tell them that they can't treat me like this, but that was met with shouting and blaming me for being a bad daughter. 

After visiting their house for the month on Christmas, I can see just how bad things really are with their habit. They don't eat properly at all, it's all junk food when my mum is a chef. They go to bed at ridiculous hours and sleep for ungodly hours. When they are awake they are yelling at each other and calling each other cunts. Me and my boyfriend have been forced to watch and counsel their arguments, and after attempting to leave and give them space they cry to be begging to help them. As a daughter who hates seeing them in pain and wants to help them I tried my best. However seeing them fight everyday for 4 weeks took a toll on my own mental health, and when we went to see my BFs family for NY it was a breath of fresh air. I didn't want to return to my parents, however I had to for an appointment they had organised for me with their world class anxiety specialist doctor friend. The catch though was that this workshop was to be held at my house. The thought of going back to that house triggered all my anxiety. So I politely told them in a message that I didn't want to go back and that with your love and support I think I can manage my anxiety just for the moment as I'm not ready to return to the house just yet. 

They called me up to tell me that I've embarrassed and hurt my father deeply and that I was bad miserable company on the holidays. For them to try and turn what happened on the holidays on me blew my mouth agape. I was so shocked that when they told me to not come back to the house in the call, I said ""fine, I will. Fuck you"" and hung up, which is something I've never said to my parents as I respect them so much. They continued to text me about how I'm a bad person, an ungrateful spoiled brat who will be a bum who drops out of uni (makes no sense as I'm doing very well at Uni), and that my boyfriend is manipulating me and an emotionally abusive partner because I stood up to them. I asked for one day of space from them and they went crazy at that too saying that as a family we have never taken space from an argument. After my one day of space I said I was ready to resolve this. They didn't contact me in 3 weeks, and when they did it was to tell me that they weren't speaking to me until I apologise. I said that I'm not going to unless you do for all the nasty shit you said about me and BF, and also get your shit together in your own aggressive lifestyle. They proceeded to call me deluded, a cunt, and when I finally brought up it's the meth addiction that's doing this, they said ""We know what we're doing kid we've been doing this for 20+ years and it has nothing to do with anything. Also you're a hypocrite because you're pothead lowlife scum"". I think the addiction has everything to do with everything. Their life is not balanced in the slightest and while we were staying there they would buy a packet of meth at least once every weekend or two. I know they are taking it to cope with their problems. But they don't want to admit that. Before we said our final goodbyes I told them I loved them very much, but they accused me of being compassionless. Mum started to cry and tell me that they are here for me and they are ""sorry for everything they did"" and that they love me too, then hung up. I'm starting to think she said that to guilt me because whenever I bring up a problem especially with them, they always incite me as the criminal in the situation, and that whatever they did just wasn't as bad as what I did. 

I feel like my heart has been shredded. I've been constantly battling that maybe I should forgive them because they are family, but then nothing will change. I've been battling that maybe I really am the bad guy and I've always been the bad unappreciative guy that doesn't deserve them. I'm completely willing to say sorry about standing up the appointment, I know that was inconvenient and even said that in my message, but I don't think it warranted all that aggression and personal hurt when they could have been diplomatic and asked me why I didn't want to come down or ease my mind about coming down. 

The worst thing is that I feel like I can't tell anyone. I want to help them, I want them to get help so bad but I feel like if I told my grandparents about it my parents would hate me forever for it. They'd hate me even more if I told my mum's sister since they hate each other and aren't even speaking. I dont know what the goal of this post is, I'm so very sorry, but I just feel so emotionally low and kind of abandoned by my parents. I dont know what I should do, I dont want them to be hurt. I've condensed things massively but this is the gist of my situation, I guess I am just seeking some outside counsel. I'm waiting to see a psych about all this soon but now that I feel essentially like I've broken up with my parents and my 20th birthday is tomorrow, I just feel incredibly sad.

Ain’t none of them fuckin sorry either.  It’s gonna be a few months or a year MAX before I’m out of here tho.  I keep getting high to pass the time until that is.  When I’m not high I have terrible PTSD flashbacks and oh god just oh god they all piss me off so bad.

All of the abuse goes back to my earliest memories, and a lot of it are just bits and pieces because I’ve blocked out a lot.  I get nightmares and anxiety over things that happened to me when I was 6 or younger to this day as a legal adult.  You know what the most fucked up part is?  It’s not even that someone was depraved enough to do such things to an innocent, defenseless child/INFANT or that my family pretended like it wasn’t happening when it SO obviously was (I had all the fucking signs, it happened all the time in our home, I’d run to other family members crying after being held down and forced into something, I hated/was afraid of that person and everyone knew it but nobody stopped it, and SO SO SO SO SO much more), but it’s that rumors have been going around since I was a little girl that I was being raped/molested by that person at home and I got asked about it frequently throughout my life (but other family members once I became an older kid and confronted them ab it trained me to deny it because I’d end up in foster care and that’d be worse yata yata)...  like a lot of these people who suspected it going on would come by the house all the time...  why the fuck didn’t anybody CALL SOCIAL SERVICES?  I COULD’VE BEEN SAVED FROM YEARS MORE WORTH OF TRAUMA, AND THE HEARTBREAK OF UR ONLY FAMILY NOT LOVING YOU ENOUGH TO CARE ABOUT UR SAFETY OR HOW YOU FEEL AND LETTING A MONSTER DO THAT AND GET 100% OFF W IT...  I’ll never be able to forgive that.  I didn’t have a childhood I didn’t get to be a child because even in my childhood years after the abuse had ended I still had constant anxiety and flashbacks and HAD TO SEE THAT PERSON ON A REGULAR BASIS AND PRETEND LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED OR ELSE I WAS CAUSING A PROBLEM...

About 9 months ago I got clean from a year long heroin habit, I always snorted and smoked. after it became too much to handle and I began considering needles, I knew I needed to get clean. So I did ibogaine and it totally worked, and I was sober for 8-9 months.

Flash forward to three days ago, I find a way to buy a gram of heroin and in a moment of weakness purchase it. I went through the gram in the last three days, all smoking. I didn’t  feel guilty but didn’t get a great high either, mainly just throwing up. 

Anyway, I don’t plan on continuing and think I can get through the minor withdrawals pretty easily with benzos and weed or even cold turkey. I just wanted to get the lapse off of my chest, and ask if any of you have similar experiences? It was odd, I really wasn’t enjoying the h and was super nauseous, but I kept smoking till it was gone .

Allow me to introduce myself, I am the disease:

**ADDICTON**

I'm cunning, overwhelming, and powerful. That's how I am. I've killed millions of people and I'm proud of it.

I love to suprise you. I love to pretend I'm your friend and your lover.
Have I not comforted you? I was there for you when you were lonely, wasn't I? Didn't you reach out to me when you wished to die?
I were there and I love to make you suffer. I love to make you cry but most of all I love to make you so numb that you can't even cry or feel pain. To the point where you can't feel anything at all.....

It's pure satisfaction. And the only thing I ask in return is that you prolong your suffering.

I've always been there for you. When everyting went well you invited me inside. You said you didn't deserve to feel good and I were the only one who agreed with you. Together we were able to destroy everything good in your life.

People don't take me serious. They take things like strokes and cardiac arrest serious; even diabetus they take serious.

Idiots.

Without my help these things wouldn't even be possible. I'm a hated disease and yet I never enter without an invitation.
You choose for me to be there with you. Many, many people have chosen me instead of peace and reality.

I hate everyone with a 12 step program, much more than you hate me.
Your program, your meetings, your higher power. All these things make me weak and I can't function as I normally can.
Now I have to just lie here, all quiet.

456,addiction,2020/01/27,"I got kicked out of my house a few days ago, i’m 17. My dad called me a “dumb ass drug addict” tl;dr - i got kicked out over my parents thinking i was doing drugs again and now i’m not entirely sure on what to do since i don’t even want to go home anymore

Okay so this happened a few days ago and I’m just at a loss right now. Brief background is that i have a history with abusing dxm aka cold meds as a way of coping. Up until a couple months ago i was sober for over a year, but i relapsed. My parents ended up finding out and they didn’t send me back to a mental hospital or anything so that was fine they just wanted the “truth” but okay believed what they wanted to hear.

So, there’s a guy i know at school who was talking to me about trying to get high on dxm but he had other active ingredients in his syrup (acetaminophen which is terrible on your liver and a serious risk in high amounts) so i told him that i’d go to the hannaford right next to school and get him the kind with only dxm in it. Now to buy that stuff you need to be 18 with an ID so i was just going to steal it for him and it’s be whatever, i tried to talk him out of trying it but if i can’t stop him might as well make sure he’s safe. Since i’m a generally sketchy looking teenager it turned out that they were following me with the cameras and chased me outside to confront me for stealing. I confessed and tried to get out of any trouble which i did for the most part. They didn’t ban me or call the cops, but they did call my parents.

Now this is where it gets bad. My dad comes clearly pissed and sees that i tried to steal dxm and him knowing some of my history with it and my last relapse he of course thought it was for me and refused to believe that i was getting it for someone else. He took me out of the store and brought me to the school which is literally almost touching it like the property lines are connected but we still fought on the way over. He was upset and everything and yelling at me and before i left he called me a “dumb ass drug addict” which honestly just really fucking hurt. I’ve always been afraid that’s how they see me and that really just solidified it for me. I went into school and had a breakdown so i couldn’t go to class since i couldn’t stop crying in the bathroom over it. 

I texted my girlfriend and told her what happened and was just freaking out and so sick of needing to deal with my parents and the way they act about the whole thing. Like yes i have an issue with it but the way they go about things is a whole other issue and only makes it worse for me. Anyways i knew i couldn’t handle school and everything that day so i decided to skip. At like 9:30 i left to my girlfriends school about an hour and a half walk away and we met up at 11 and went to her house for a while to talk. I told her that i’m not going home for at least another day because i just couldn’t handle my parents at the moment. 

At around 2:50 when i’d usually be home from school i left her house since her grandparents would be home soon and texted my parents the same thing. That i was extremely hurt and yeah i messed up in one way or another but i still can’t stand to be near them. After some fighting over text it got to a point where my mom said i’m not welcome back home until i start “telling the truth” since they don’t believe me and that they won’t have any drugs in their house (which is bullshit since my dad smokes weed 24/7). 

Now it’s been a few days and I’ve been staying with my girlfriend so far but now on school nights i need to find somewhere to stay. I have a few friends i can bounce between to have somewhere to sleep and i’m getting a job within the next week to find someone who’s willing to let me pay a small rent to just sleep in a guest room or even on the couch. My girlfriends grandparents have been extremely understanding and they care about me so they’re willing to help me but obviously i can’t rely on them forever. Even they think that my parents are doing a terrible job right now and need to change their ways so until some miracle happens and they stop being like that i’m gonna be out of the house. According to her grandmom who’s been in contact with my mom, my mom wants me to come home now but i don’t think that’s gonna happen. Being at home makes me want to relapse way more then whatever you wanna call where i am now.

My sister [25F] and I had a very unstable childhood, but we've managed to become productive adults who are working towards better futures. My dad was clean for a while, and my brothers [15M, 8M] seemed okay. Not perfect, but their bills were paid and they had food on the table. Things were stable.

Now, he's out of control again. He stopped going to work. He can't afford his bills or groceries, despite having food assistance, HUD assistance, and recently getting disability. I've had to pay his bills several times because my brothers will suffer if I don't. He's bringing known criminals with violent histories into the house. Last time he was like this, he lost his house and all of his possessions. My brothers also lost everything. 

My sister and I are trying to intervene before this happens again. I don't see my dad getting and staying better, but we're hoping we can convince him to go back to rehab. If not, we still need to find a way to get my brothers out of his care. My brothers' moms aren't in the picture, and our grandparents are dead. So, my sister and I are their only options.

What helped me in the past - with porn addiction - was a small accountability group (in whatsapp) with 4-5 people who report honestly and support each other if somebody relapses. I want to create the same now for my youtube addiction. Youtube addicts prefered, but if it is another internet addiction for you, I guess that is also fine.

I read a book called This Naked Mind that re trained my mind for a while, like Allen Carr's Easy Way to quit smoking, but with alcohol. Getting the sub conscious on board changes everything. The mountain was a mole hill.

I want to talk about that sober period.

Doing things, activities, for the sake of doing them, was brand new to me. Choosing the people around me kept life interesting. Boredom is always a challenge, but life has to be good enough on its own.

That's the difference to people who haven't been addicted... Yet. They enjoy life. Don't forget that the trap is there for all. Who knows what will trigger someone into addiction for the first time. 

Is life easy to choose? Nope. Not if you've never done it, or practiced it. Even if you have. 

I remember that I wasn't miserable, I didn't show up to meetings like a wild man. I just didn't put the poison in my one and only body. Sobriety was obvious. 

Fast forward to today. Big problems, because I forgot to keep the sub conscious sharp and practiced. But it's malleable. After a while, I won't be addicted. I'm very frustrated now, but sharing this helps. 

No one chooses addiction. It's not a moral failing.

But I go to asia a lot, and spend money on seeking out girls, prostitutes etc. most of those encounters suck, then if I find a girl who wants to stay with me, she ends up just being my toy I have to use all the time, until shes worn out or sick of me.

I hate constantly obsessing over needing a fix, I cant focus on any life goals, I've basically put my life on hold for a decade, constantly seeking out girls, with so many failures or lost interests. all this effort I could have put in to making money to be a financially secure partner, instead I have no work ethic and no passion for anything, 

except sex.

I'm always transient living in hotels or hostels, usually in asia because of girls and because of social anxiety back home in the us, and because it's cheaper to live and I can never find a way to settle down and just work on one thing.

I'm only briefly in the US, and was going to leave, but then the corona virus hit, I'm not too keen to go, yet at the same time my living situation ends in a week, and I really have no idea how to establish myself, especially in an area with absolutely no transportation and any big city is 2 hours drive away.


I realized I do have a problem when a girl I met, decided to come over, and later I found out she was working in a gogo bar, having sex with others. I didnt use protection with her and then still didnt after she told me this. Luckily my hiv test came back negative, but I havent done the 3 month test yet.

I'm 30, and always have this burning urge to release. maybe no impulse control. and almost impossible not to want to/try to have sex with any woman, instead of just a friendship. I think this even ruined a friendship, when I couldnt stop flirting with my friend's wife...she did seem to be quite receptive though it was weird.. I distanced myself from them.

I also noticed I hardly have any male friends. and the girls who are my friends, we have an ambiguous nature...maybe I have poor boundaries or am too needy, and they find it as I'm interested in them? or I invoke empathy in others easily because I'm a disaster.

therapy isnt really an option unless there's some cheap online type. I really dont know what else to do. I cant even give myself a stable living...nor do I really want to. cant stand being locked into something.",492,1.0,2,0.0040650406504065045

It will not just give you detoxification but also provide treatment. This treatment can be complete or partial. It depends on the severity of your addiction and the type of center you want to go to.

If you are staying at a residential drug detox center, then you will be given a total body detox. This is very important because it allows you to be free from any type of addictive substances. The main reason for this kind of treatment is to be free from any type of harmful substance.

If you are going to the outpatient part of the treatment, then you can visit a detox center or a treatment center anytime of the day. This is completely optional, but most people prefer it. However, you still need to go to your designated area in order to complete the treatment. This is very important in order to provide you with total detoxification.

A drug detoxification center can help you get into recovery after they give you a detoxification program. Once you are free from the substance, you can always go back to the center if you so wish.

One of the best things about a drug detoxification center is that they provide complete treatment without any restrictions. With this option, you can feel like the treatment will never end. There are not any withdrawal symptoms that you have to deal with. You just need to move on with your life after finishing the program.

If you are suffering from [alcoholism](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/), then this type of treatment may be best for you. After treatment, you can live your life normally without having to drink.

If you choose the outpatient alcohol detox center, then you need to schedule time for treatment every week. This type of treatment is for those who are not suffering from any type of substance abuse problem.

Inpatient treatment may be better than outpatient detox center. This type of treatment allows you to give it a try even if you do not want to stay in a facility for a long time. When you need some time away from home, alcohol rehab centers are there to provide you with the same treatment that is available in any residential centers.

Every Alcohol rehab centers can provide you with different types of treatment. However, the fact remains that inpatient treatment is the most suitable one. However, if you are truly suffering from alcoholism, then go for any type of treatment that is recommended by your doctor.",542,0.0,0,0.0

I also have had on and off alcohol problems for the past two years or so.

I relapsed with alcohol this week. I have an amazing job that I love with a super supportive team but I am living with my parents while waiting for my new place to be ready for me to move in the spring.

My relationship with my parents is overall fine, but we definitely have problems that are super triggering for me. They are either hover/smother/helicopter over me or completely ignore my issues and pretend everything is fine. They also have very selfish tendencies and will do whatever it takes to keep doing what they want to do.

My parents want to move to a different house close by, and put the current house on the market. I told them it was too much for me to worry about constantly showing the house and stuff, but they do it anyway. I have mentioned suicidal thoughts and potential relapse, but they are still focused on the house. I don't think there is anything I can say to make them actually do what I need them to do.

After a weekend of cleaning the house and running around to let the house be shown, I had a breakdown. I told my parents that if they don't take the house off the market until I move out, that I will drink myself to death. Their solution? Only show the house when I'm not home, and sneak around the house whispering about moving (as if I can't hear them but I can). So like I said, they care slightly, but selfishly keep doing whatever they want to do. It has been like this my whole life and is probably the #1 reason I fell into addiction in the first place.

Idk what to do, I know I need help but I worry about getting my parents involved. No matter what, they will make it harder for me and hurt more than help. They don't let me go anywhere without asking a million questions, so going to meetings privately is not an option.

I am seeing my therapist on Friday, so I will talk through this with her, but I'm honestly scared to death. I don't want to fuck up my job because I love it, I don't want things to get even more difficult at home. I just have no idea how I'll get through this.",441,0.0,0,0.0

I am currently in the process of cutting down, and determined to get this out of my life once and for all.

 For the past 2years or so I have been taking 4 zapain (co codamol 30/500) tablets, 3 times a day, with 4 hours between each dose.

I have researched this and now know it's the paracetamol in these tablets that damage the liver.

Is there anybody out there that has been through a similar thing that can comment on if this sort of quantity causes major irreversable damage? 

I have recently had a liver blood test....which the doctor said looks fine but I've read these tests are  not accurate in showing damage done? Maybe a liver scan will show damage over a blood test ? And with this going on for so long I am finding it very hard to believe no damage has been done. My mind is racing at the moment and I am worrying allot, as I have come to the realisation of how serious this. 

Just cannot believe how stupid I have been, I hope someone can reply and speak about this with me.

The title basically says it all, to further extend: I'm not actually smoking a lot of weed, maybe like once every two weeks, once a week at most. But I used to smoke like once a month and only with friends like 3 months back. Now I've also smoked alone sometimes and I feel the urge to smoke some a lot more often. The feeling comes back after I did smoke more quickly. But on the other hand that's basically all, I don't have any negative effects. I have loads of good friends, sports 4 times a week, uni is going great and I'm graduating soon. I also don't feel the need to pass on other activities in order to get high, it's just that when I'm alone at home after a day of studying for example, I feel like ""I could get high now"". If a friend would call me that moment and ask to hang out, I would have no problem ditching the weed and meeting him/her. But I feel like consuming drugs always is like a walk on the edge.

498,addiction,2020/01/30,"I've smashed too many drugs at partys Hello 

Where do I start. 23 year old disabled male. Like alot here, my life revolves around drugs. Been smoking weed daily for 5 years, and I've been drinking for a bit longer. I can go a week or two here and there without alcohol, but when I do drink I'll binge for few days till I can feel myself deteriorating. This was ok. A little over a year ago however I did mdma for the first time and I feel like that has taken my addictions next level. I also did ketamine around then aswell. Fuck even just thinking about my first times on mdma I'm getting cravings. I was glowing, I felt connection with everything. Quickly though it started to cook me. No serotonin left. 

I party with mates alot. I play in DIY garage bands around my city. Last time I snorted a drug was at a rave. Thought I got my friends mdma, turned out to be speed. Whoops. That was a few weeks ago. Before this, I told myself I wouldn't do it until June. Lol.
Every come down is just getting worse and worse. And then I'll have some ketamine to make the few days after easier. I actually think I have done some serious damage. Over the year I would've averaged about 2 nights on mdma every 3 weeks. All those nights I've had a lot too. Some house party's I threw ran from Friday to Monday, essentially being a drug den after the first night. It's so fucking stupid but so much fun.

If I keep doing this I'm going to fuck myself up hardcore. I know that. I just don't like sobriety. I had a major stroke as a young child and without going into too much detail, that whole experience gave me massive ptsd and depression. I think it has something to do with that, although my dad is a functioning addict aswell and as far as I'm concerned he did not have too difficult of a past.  

I will stop, I just hope I do it's before it's too late. I practice mindfulness and non duality (advaita vedanta/some schools of Buddhism) so I am very aware of my thoughts and existence. But why do I still do it? I swear, every time now right as I'm about to snort or eat it in a cap it's just like I'm sitting in the back of my head thinking ""holy shit what a dumbass"" about myself. My body is detached and just does drugs. Why the fuck does it do that? Aaahhh  

Anyway I forgot the point of this. I'm going to smoke some weed. Hopefully I'll post in a few months saying I'm clean from mdma/ket/speed. Making this post could be a real seed. Beautiful.

Available in VIC, Australia - I didn't know it existed until a few weeks ago, but maybe something similar near you? I've been struggling with alcohol for over half my life (33f), cocaine use for the past 3 years, and a smorgasbord of consistent heavy recreational dabbling throughout. I went off the rails at the end of last year, and a dear group of friends stepped in for a heart wrenching (and admittedly very well done) intervention a few week ago.

I'm 3 weeks into this program called ""Ready 2 Change"": [https://www.directline.org.au/ready-2-change](https://www.directline.org.au/ready-2-change)

I was told of them when I spoke to an online counsellor here: [https://www.counsellingonline.org.au/](https://www.counsellingonline.org.au/)

I didn't like AA at all. I've responded well to SMART meetings in the past but I've been unable to attend meetings in person, the online ones weren't really cutting it. R2C have online modules to work through that echo the SMART Cognitive Behavioural Therapy approach. I'm really appreciating the one on one attention and my counsellor is wonderful.

Hope this recommendation might be able to do something good for you, or at least help you find something similar in your area if it's your jam.

I always felt strongly against the fact that I had an addiction to video games. But I need to start being honest with myself so I figure this is the best place. 

I’ve been told to just moderate my time but I can’t. I come home from work and instead of being productive like furthering my career or aspirations I just sit and play videos games until 2 or 3 only to wake up 5 hours later. I do this almost everyday. I feel like I’m at the point where I can’t go to bed without playing. I tell myself I’ll only play a few games but it never turns into that. I’m starting to realize that these are normal symptoms of addiction. The worst part is I sold my gaming system 6 months ago and things were great. My relationships, work ethic, job life. 
I just saw it one day and thought “maybe I’m better now. I won’t go overboard again” so I bought another one. And now it has gotten back to the point. 

I consider myself a pretty antisocial person I really enjoy playing video games. They have been a big part of my life and have got me through tough times. Something about encompassing myself into a virtual world and just being “away from life” is something that I enjoy very much. But I know it’s really bad. I know I should just sell it again and keep it out of my life. I dont know what’s stopping me. Maybe I just need reinforcement. I’m 23 with a lot of career aspirations and goals. But I really feel like it’s ruining my life. Just to. Throw this out there, It’s 4 in the morning and I can’t sleep. Just got finished staring at a screen for 5 hours. Can’t sleep.",349,0.0,0,0.0

I just found out, [in this article](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324768.php#mood), that *a 2015 study showed that caffeine does not directly stimulate dopamine production. Instead, it increases the number of available dopamine receptors in the brain. This may enhance dopamine's overall effect on the brain*.  

By having more dopamine receptors available you are more susceptible to cravings because you experience them more intensely. I've started and quit coffee 10 times now over the years. There was a pattern where I would ""fall off the wagon"" (relapse) during the periods in my life where I was drinking coffee but I didn't have the data to confirm this.

I’ve got a need for speed and after a month-ish break of only doing adderall once while drunk, slipped right back. 

Woke up early Tuesday morning excited to take vyvanse and run my day with power and control. Turned into 280mg  and not sleeping until nearly Thursday morning. Got some glimpses through trying to hypnotize myself. 
Buddy left town yesterday morning and his adderall here with me to sell. Ended up taking 6.5 30mg IRs starting at roughly 8am.

24 hours later, out 65$, mouth bleeding from working my tongue, muscles twitching,  gonna be out of pocket until Saturday, shit to do today, nothing to do but sit on the balcony to stay sane.  

The comedown isn’t what’s getting me, it’s the fondness of it. I feel it. This is a critical time to make a decision. If I don’t cut this shit off now, it’s gonna be a long one. 1-3 months solid, worshipping being twacked, going MIA, the whole thing I’m sure y’all know it.

I am a recovering pot addict. Some people may not believe pot is an issue, but it caused severe problems in my life. The most recognizable is how it affected the people around me. When I say pot addiction, I mean I was high every second unless I was asleep for a year (started before that but there was a year of constant smoking.) In that time I met a guy and we fell in love. But I hurt him. I would prefer not to say all I did to him, but trust me, it was horrible. We broke up about two months ago, and i’ve been a month sober (which is a lot for me, like i said i didn’t even go a day sober for a year). 

He gave me a lot of chances. Far too many. He even blames himself and ended things off saying he can’t hurt ME anymore. 

I want to write him an apology letter (in person is not an option, and a phone call isn’t either) but I don’t even know where to begin.

526,addiction,2020/02/01,Recovery? So my sister started doing drugs like weed and alcohol at age 13 ish and started dabbling with heroin and crystal meth around the same time but she didn’t get bad on those drugs until about age 16 and from that point she was really lost and went to rehab once when she was 17 and even went out of the state with some family to try to escape for a while but every time she came back she ended doing the same thing. She had two babies and for the first one she stayed clean most the pregnancy but for the second the baby was affected from her drug use.

She occasionally laughs to herself and mostly just spends her time sitting around in her grandmas room or like in the kitchen. She can still speak and hold a conversation but seems to take a while to focus on what you’re saying. She prefers not to talk about old things because she gets angry and hurt.

Overtime I’ve reduced that number and for the most part, I only drink socially with friends or when im on my own time. I’ve become much more responsible with it. 

Last night was when the realization hit me that I might have a problem. The coin fell the wrong way and I was designated driver for my group of friends. I was fine with this, as I wanted them to enjoy their time. 

When we got to the club, however, I couldn’t bring myself to have a good time. Completely sober, I danced to a few songs, socialized within my group, but that was pretty much the extent of my night.

531,addiction,2020/02/01,"Long post - but I really need your help As the title says, I am addicted to love. And no, I don't mean loving a person compassionately, for who they are, or loving a hobby or an activity because you simply enjoy it - I mean the feeling of being addicted to it. I have a long history of obsessive behaviors but it all started 5 years ago when I fell in love for the first time. It drove me crazy. I couldn't focus on anything and my life slowly became a blur because the only thing that I cared about was my crush. It was a happy occurrence because the feeling was mutual and we soon got together but the obsession grew even stronger. I would refuse to study (I was in college at the time), do chores and have a normal routine because of being in love. All I wanted was to spend time with him, my mind was constantly obsessed with him and ruminating about him. But one year later, I crashed down because one day I woke up simply not feeling in love anymore. I was craving that soul-consuming feeling, I was craving it like it was some sort of drug. I was ruined. I desperately tried to trick my mind into falling back in love but nothing did the trick. I realized that life without infatuation was awful and I tried to kill myself. Twice. I failed, as you can see. That is when I became addicted to the feeling of infatuation.

&amp;nbsp;

Approximately a year later, I found a band. I'd liked that band ever since I was a kid but never overplayed it - I knew and liked a few songs but that was all. But now, it felt like I resonated with this band more than I've ever resonated with anything in my life, so I started to listen to this band obsessively. I would spend my entire day listening to the music, not doing the stuff I so desperately NEEDED to so because I was too busy obsessing over my new favorite band. This time I almost lost my job because of it. I would show up late to work because I was too busy watching some interview i'd found or watching a live performance. I started collecting records, bootlegs, interviews, performances, and anything I could get my hands on. In addition, I started to have a crush on the lead singer too - who has been dead for many, many years. I drove my best friend crazy talking to him about it, and he told me one day ""you're legit obsessed, this is not normal"". This obsession was probably even stronger than my first love, mainly because it was intangible and people crave what the can't have. The band doesn't exist anymore and the leader/guitarist/vocalist is dead and has been dead for a long time. I didn't care, I continued doing my thing, ignoring everything that didn't have anything to do with my obsession for this band. This obsession faded too eventually, leaving me heartbroken and destroyed. I looked everywhere to find out what was happening to me and why I was no longer infatuated. Suicidal thoughts again. Pain. Tears. Existential crisis. I would obsessively listen to the songs and try to find that lost feeling again, but it was all in vain. This was so painful I tried to kill myself again. And yes, I am REALLY bad at killing myself and I'm too much of a pussy to actually try a more promising method (I've only tried to OD). I also couldn't tell anyone, not even to my therapist, that I tried killing myself because I no longer resonated with a band. It seemed so superficial that I was scared people would laugh at me.

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward a few months later, I am in withdrawals. I constantly crave that connection with something that I resonate with. But now it's gotten even worse - as a replacement for the infatuation that I can no longer feel, now I've started gambling. I've gambled all my savings. Gambled away my monthly wage. Gambled away everything I've had.



 I feel empty and I feel like I can't fill that emptiness with anything. Believe me when I say this - therapy doesn't work for me. I know everyone will recommend me therapy but i'm at this point where i've tried most therapists in my area and i still don't see any results. I've tried counseling, systematic therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Meds aren't working either. I am on Cymbalta (120mg/day, which is a substantial dose), Abilify and I also take CBD, B vitamin complex and GABA supplements. I've tried countless other meds in the past and nothing has curbed the withdrawals and the obsessive behaviors. I am really sorry for this absolute block of text but I don't know what to do and where to go anymore. At this point I just want someone to tell me ""hey i've been in the same boat and it gets better"" but I honestly have no idea if anyone can relate. I just felt like opening up and maybe someone can give me some insight on what to do because I feel like an absolute failure and life has become unbearable.

So I’ve been going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings for quite some time now with my dad. Neither of us drink and he claims to go because he wants to meet people and reconnect with old friends apparently. I just go just for my personal amusement. It’s fun to watch losers talk about their pathetic lives in front of other losers.

But as you would expect, I’m not vocal at all about this at meetings. I just sit there silently trying to blend in without saying anything aside from the shit that everyone else says when everyone holds hands and are in a circle. It’s a feeling of *epicaricacy* that is hidden from everyone else.

I’ve heard some unique stories from my time there. There was once this man who grew up with his adopted family in Tijuana and then one day a robber came murdered his entire family when he wasn’t home. This guy claimed that the event put him in “so much rage” that’s what made him a drinker. When I told The Boy Named Crow about this, he just said “Damn that sucks.”. I said I thought that moment was pretty funny because of how cartoonish it was. It’s kinda weird that this one guy was apparently able to murder an entire household when just trying to kill 2 people on your own can be pretty difficult. It just fell into the realm of unreality.

There always seems to be an old woman with brown hair whenever I go there. I don’t know why.

Yesterday me and dad went to this meeting and this guy was telling this very long story and since we just walked in during the middle of it I don’t really know the whole story and he kept going on about rabbis and god or whatever. The room was really dark which made sense since it was at 10 something PM and I just kept staring at the white LED lights hung on the wall behind him as he spoke and the patterns they made or the ceiling fan and the slow movement it made before it made it’s eventual stop. I remember there was this old guy sitting in a chair in a corner of the room on my right saying stuff like “Oh god is this guy still talking?” but no one except me seemed to notice him when he said that at all.

When the guy finally stopped talking all of a sudden some guy in the crowd got up with his shitty acoustic guitar and started playing some shitty song and singing. I told dad “This song is shit.” and “We should split.”. But dad wanted to stay and said no and I can just go to the car and wait for him if I’d like. But I insisted that “We should go.” and eventually I decided to walk home by myself and asked for house keys, which he gave to me.

I just walked home alone that night listening to some podcast that doesn’t suck and went to sleep not long after returning home.

546,addiction,2020/02/02,"What the F should I do? (Addiction starting again after 8 years.) I still have my job, I get good grades in school (studying to assistent nurse). I love my son and my gf. 

The thing is, I use Vyvanse to study, which creates a vicious cycle of anxiety and depression. Now I cant study without it. A month ago I got prescribed Diazepam for my stuttering and anxiety, thought I could handle it well. Now a few weeks later I buy Xanax and other Bzd from the black market to fill out my consumption. I also have a sex addiction to either porn or random encounters, I dont care if the girl looks like crap, I just want my high. 

The whole thing started of with smoking weed and loosing my license, then it escalated. 

I know that I can be happy without drugs, I have been there before.. I was drug free for 8 YEARS before all of this, I drank moderately and rarely though. Now I take everything I can get my hands on. My morals have slowly faded... I rarely even started to take Oxy at night once a week. 

The good thing though, is that I hate alcohol, cant stand the hangover so I rarely drink. It just makes me feel ill even when drunk. Poison.

Im starting to loose my mind... I cant go into rehab because I have to work and study otherwise my life falls apart completely. Is there an option? I dont like like AA meetings because of my stutter. 

What can I do to stop myself? Now its sunday, I went to sleep laaaate at night waking up with huge anxiety, as many times before. Been studying the whole night on Vyvanse. This is slowly eating me up.

Trying to hold back on the codeine/coke/valium/etc but Cannibis and as little alcohol as possible helps get me through, especially in the evenings.

I don't understand why I feel such a crippling loneliness so often but I know that even when I was back at my uni town with all my friends the same feeling always crept in.

We sit here and make excuses as to why we get high and do drugs but really these are just things society makes us think we have. I thought I had anxiety as well but really I didn’t suffer from shit. I was definitely sad and depressed because of things that happened in my life but it’s normal to be sad when you suffer trauma. I just smoked too much weed from when I was young and I grew up with a lack of confidence in myself and from all the weed I smoked I really lost a lot of brain cells. I didn’t like talking to people because I didn’t like serious conversations, although I was smart I really forgot my words sometimes and it was embarrassing. When you do drugs for a long time your brain is in a gray fog state. Get off the drugs and suffer and your life will change. I promise you guys are fine.

554,addiction,2020/02/02,"Have I ruined my life? I went to a 'networking event' the other night, only had 4 glasses of wine but I'm pretty small and a lightweight (25/F). Headed home with a friend - we live in college campus accommodation.

He made it back to his room but I was stopped on the way in and deemed 'incredibly intoxicated'. I had honestly been fine up until that point but I guess it all hit me pretty hard on the way home. 

Campus security basically decided I needed to go to hospital to be checked out, but I insisted I was fine and just wanted to head to my room. They eventually relented and escorted me to my room, but not without telling my roommate about the incident and instructing her to take care of me. (For context, it's a building housing only grad students and professors, so drinking is not forbidden).

Obviously my roommate was furious and kept asking me what drugs I had taken, not believing me when I told her I hadn't. Once I thought she had gone to bed, I decided to avoid the tension by heading to a friend's room on a different floor (he invited me over). Unfortunately he had changed room recently, so a Resident Assistant then found me on a different floor waiting for him to text me back, she definitely did not believe me that I was meeting someone so brought me back to my floor. FINALLY got in touch with my friend, went to his and vented/recovered from the incident.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day I got an email from the Residential Services with an 'account' of the night before and checking that I was okay. I responded but they are out of office for the weekend. I also emailed the Resident Assistant in question and she was super nice about everything.

&amp;#x200B;

ANYWAY I'm completely freaking out. The past two days I haven't left my room because I'm too scared to face my roommate, let alone the building security guys on front desk. I'm literally petrified but this can't go on forever. I can't believe this all escalated so fast over a few glasses of wine. 

WTF do I do? Will I face major repercussions for this?

556,addiction,2020/02/02,"Am I an addict? 17 years old ! Hi guys I’m having some trouble with identifying if I am an addict or not. So when I was 14 I started to smoke weed everyday and would get introuble but didn’t care, eventually I found alcohol started to drink occasionally and then found Xanax and ambien. Shortly after I turned 15 I was taking xanxs as often as possible smoking weed, drinking lean, booze, ambien, hydros. I overdosed 3 times got suspended. Was getting drug tested from parents and school and had fake urine to pass all tests. Would get in trouble all the time and it sucked. I was majorly depressed I didn’t take my meds, had anxiety, defiance issues and shit sucked. I wanted to die. That Christmas I was sent to a wilderness program for 2 months where I graduated and went directly to a therapeutic boarding school. I was in treatment for a total of 16 MONTHS! Terrible but I needed it and I knew I was an addict. After coming home I was heavily involved in AA and there wasn’t a doubt in my mind that I was an addict. Shortly after my 17 birthday I started to question myself.  I began to experiment and I have drunken socially tons of times since. I have smoked weed maybe 5 times but got caught so I have stopped. I don’t ever feel the need to like get drunk or high and have no problem stopping. I want to tel my therapist that I have drank and smoked and I have been fine but she will tell my mom. I told my mom that I thought I was smoking someone nicotine vape but it had weed in it (when I got caught) although I knew it was weed. My question is if I am still an addict or not. I belive that the reason shit was so bad when I was younger is because well I was younger. Although I’m only 17 the emotional maturity from 14/15 to 17 is huge. I think that I didn’t have a lot of friends and was resentful at life.

558,addiction,2020/02/03,"Seeking advice Hello all,

(This is a long post)

I’m in a tricky situation and I’m not sure if I can fix it but I’m trying my best.

My brother had some shit things happen and fell into a meth addiction a few years ago. I love this dude so much - at heart he is a very kind and thoughtful dude. When on the substance he is a completely different person. This change in character has lead to some pretty serious legal ramifications and now part of his bail is that he has to be with my mother at all times. 

She is toxic and I don’t believe he can heal with her. I am fighting tooth and nail to try and get him to a better set up.
Due to her actions none of our family want to interact with her. I had gone NC for my own well being but now again feel myself forced to be around her.

I’m about to sound kind of fickle and selfish - obviously he comes first - I’ve dropped everything to move back here for the month and try and help and get things on track - but this is really putting all of us in a very toxic environment.

1. My dad spent 10 years trapped in litigation with my mother following their separation that was a result of decades of abuse. He’s a good guy and didn’t want to just cut off her cash flow and kept trying to leave her in a situation where she would be financially comfortable - she took advantage of this. He lost basically his whole life to her and just finally in the last year got free and moved to a job he loves. Then this happened and now he is trapped in the cycle with her again because he wants to help my brother and she is manipulating and complicating things.

2. My family - they decided to be NC with her but want to help my brother and are also back trapped with her 

3. Me - I wanted to be NC because she makes me feel very unsafe and I too am now involved. This part isn’t a super big deal - my brother comes first and I can suck it up temporarily 

We all want to help him. Thousands of dollars have gone into this issue and so
Has an immense amount of effort.

I plan on sitting down with him and having an overall talk just about how much he matters to me, what it was like being with him under the influence etc, I’ve been mulling this convo over in my head to find the perfect way to phrase things in a caring but impactful way without being too pushy

The part I’m struggling with is;

He still thinks he can do meth once in a while. I don’t believe that is possible. He’s been clean for months and if he goes back again at square one. We’ve been trying to help and get this sorted for 2 years now. I don’t think we can do this endlessly and I don’t know if he can realize this and make the choice to not take that risk.

I don’t know what it’s like for him, I don’t know the mindset that can go with it. I don’t want to be harsh and kinda say “you’re putting us all through hell we need you to stop” - we love him and want to make sure he is healthy and happy but we too have to take care of ourselves after a bit

559,addiction,2020/02/03,"I need to grow a pair with my addict partner :/ Hi, I'm 28(F) dating 35(M), we've been together for a little over 3 years. I found out about his opiate addiction about 6 months into our relationship. And yes I feel like a moron for being completely oblivious to this, I am not what I consider a naïve person, I've done plenty of drugs in my life so I am the last person to judge, but on a very recreational level. I have learned I definitely do not have an addictive personality through this experience. This has been an emotional roller coaster for so many reasons. He is a very high functioning addict. He runs his own business, super successful, we do not want for anything. He probably spends 150k plus on pills per year but you'd never know it. He doesn't miss the money. &lt;- (makes me sick even typing it as I make 40k a year but that's besides the point.)

We've fought over him getting sober more times than I can count. Yes he admits he has a problem but has never been to an actual rehab. He's tried suboxone a few times but claims he hates it (The more I've learned about it, I believe he has put himself in PW and makes it even worse.)

I finally had it this weekend after an argument seemingly unrelated to addiction but his attitude becomes erratic and nasty when he's unable to get pills and he will never admit it but I know his behavior well enough to know that's why he was acting that way. Hes not abusive, doesn't steal, doesn't cheat, etc. But he is taking idk how many Roxy's a day and its made him very isolated I guess I would say. I KNOW I need to leave. So please keep the mean comments to a minimum, as I am completely heartbroken. He is the love of my life and I know I can't make him change but it doesn't make it any easier. I guess I'm wondering if leaving will even do anything or if this has been a complete waste of my time, love, loyalty, and energy. I wish I could leave my emotions out of it. I haven't spoken to him in a couple of days but I know he will probably say everything I want to hear when we do so I just want to mentally prepare for it. I've threatened to leave before but never followed through. 

I don't have a ton of people to talk to about it, I feel bad burdening my friends with it as i'm already burdening them asking if me and my dog can crash at their place until I figure out where i'm going to move. We have super intertwined lives between living together having animals together etc so it's not like I can pack up and leave in a day as I don't have unlimited funds to go buy my own place.

I just want to know that there's light at the end of this tunnel. I thought I was going to marry him. I'm pretty heartbroken. Thanks for reading.",554,0.0,0,0.0

I feel like for the past 5 years drugs have just been my life and I've not been able to focus on anything else. My first major problem started with benzo abuse as I started ordering etizolam from the clearnet and quickly fell in love with benzos as I felt like they turned me into a social god, which is a great feeling for me as I'm quite a shy/introverted guy by default.

I became seriously hooked on benzos at 17/18 and was doing shit tons of them, usually mixed with opiates too like heroin or morphine. It's really crazy that I'm still alive and I still feel some derealisation because how the f can I have survived all the times nodding out on midazolam/oxy etc when I was probably 2 missed breaths away from dying. I spent my 18th birthday being resuscitated from a heroin/xanax overdose and it's such a shameful, disturbing memory.

Recently though, I've been to rehab and am actually sort of getting things on track. I'm about 3 months clean from all benzos and opiates although I did have a small relapse on opiates a few weeks ago. 

The problem is, another devil has popped up now. Cocaine. The place where I live in the UK is fucking packed to the brim with cocaine and nearly everyone I know does it. Every weekend is the same, I go out for 'a couple of drinks' and come home at 8 in the morning having spent all the money in my bank account and am completely depressed for about a week after.

It's time for me to stop this shit before it gets a lot worse. I'm going to have to stop drinking alcohol completely as I can't psychically drink alcohol without getting insane coke cravings.

She suffers from depression, anxiety, and recently psychosis. 
Her argument is that she was more functioning when she high. And part of me agrees with her. 
When she was using, she was at college (UK) studying and gained good results, going in for every lesson, and leaving the the house on days off with me to do activities together. 

Since sober, she has attempted university but couldn’t manage it (which is absolutely understandable and fine) but has since locked her self away, rarely leaving the house. She sleeps until 14:00 (when I finish work). I encourage to do things together but she is content in sitting in silence without any stimulation during evenings. 

Due to antipsychotic medication she has put on weight (which in itself is not a problem) but she feels worthless because of it; believes people stare at her if she leaves the house - which has prevented her from going to NA meetings.

574,addiction,2020/02/04,"Unhealthy obsession with adult games. Hello guys,

I've  been browsing the subs for the past few hours deciding where to post  this because I'm not sure. Feel free to remove it or move it if I'm in  the wrong place.

Let me preface  the rest of this post by saying that this is probably a laughable  matter, especially taking into account what other people go through and  this most certainly isn't easy for me to write but I really don't know  anymore.

So I've had a rough  couple of years with a series of deaths in the family that were months  apart, which brought on quite a lot of stress and financial strain but  things have been clearing up recently. I also lost the connection with  most of my friends. During that time when things were quiet I discovered  a few adult (porn) that I really enjoyed and they've helped me relax,  and them having updates it allowed me to get invested.

The  issue started manifesting when those type of games started adding more  ""group oriented"", content (NTR and such). I quit playing them of course  as I'm more of a vanilla kind of a guy when it comes to these issues.  But I'm constantly being drawn back to them and it makes me feel  horrible like it's actually happening to me (they're pixel character for  f's sake). It's been a few months and whenever something reminds of  those games I get anxious and start feeling down and unmotivated which  has led to me feeling hollow, I cannot find enjoyment in anything that I  try to occupy myself with.

This  has extended to impact anything that has a sexual component in it when  it comes to entertainment material (comics, games etc.) I have no such  issues when viewing regular adult material, also I'm quite able to  discern that this has nothing to do with real life so it doesn't cause  me issues with normal human interaction.

I'm  reaching a breaking point and I feel totally dazed and embarrassed, I  could never have imagined that I would have this kind of a issue.",369,0.0,0,0.0

584,addiction,2020/02/04,"Friend is addicted to Ambien (took me a while to figure out) Hi guys, not sure why I'm writing this post except that this issue has been bugging me. Basically, I have an acquaintance/friend, let's call her ""Sally,"" who let it slip a couple times that she uses Ambien every day. She works night shifts at a hospital and  would have easy access to prescriptions. It's clear from the way she mentioned her Ambien use that she's already completely justified it to herself due to having ""insomnia"" and needing to sleep.

I do understand insomnia is a real problem for people. But you're not supposed to take Ambien for chronic, long-term use (longer than 2 weeks is considered excessive, apparently). I'm under the impression that Sally has been taking this drug for months, if not years, to cope with her work schedule and keep her job. But I can't help but wonder what the long term effects are going to be for her if she keeps up this lifestyle??

I've basically let the friendship go at this point due to Sally's odd behavior, such as sleeping all day (even on days when she's not working), not answering calls, and never calling back when she says she will due to sleeping, feeling sick/groggy, or having severe headaches. When we did manage to talk on the phone or in person, she just seems really sluggish and ""zombied-out."" I used to think that it was because she's just a naturally calm person, but when I finally put two-and-two together, I realized it's because she's hung over from taking Ambien the night before. The drug is constantly in her bloodstream!

I honestly don't understand how someone could justify the daily use of a powerful hypnotic-sedative drug like Ambien? I've tried a few sleeping pills in the past (like Advil PM), and that shit makes me feel horrible the next day. 

Can someone please give me insight into my friend's addiction and what the long-term consequences could be for her? I don't know if I should say anything. I don't feel it's my place to bring it up, but if it does come up at some point in the future, I don't know if I could hold back my opinion since it's clearly a damaging habit to have.

586,addiction,2020/02/04,"Genuinely ADHD but addicted to and abusing meds 
I’m afraid to admit this and am really afraid to get help because I know they will take me off my meds but I think I may have a problem. I am super dependent on my ADHD meds (diagnosed as a kid) but not because they help me function but because they are the only things that make me feel remotely happy or motivated. And I love the jittery feeling I get when I take more than is prescribed. I would take 3 or 4 times as much as I’m prescribed if I had enough. It’s mainly a relief from my depression. Or I’m just so dependent my brain can’t make dopamine anymore. 

I’ve never taken any other kind of upper but I fantasize about cocaine all the time. If I had the money or the chance I know it would ruin me. I don’t think I could resist. Anyway, I keep taking more than prescribed of my vyvanse/adderall whether I need to study or not. Just so I don’t have to feel tired and depressed. And I feel extremely attached to my meds. I carry them around with me and get almost emotional about them. I am always making sure I have them and scheming ways to get more. 

Anyway, I lie to doctors about my anxiety and my (past) psychotic symptoms so they won’t stop prescribing them to me. I’ve even got two separate psychiatrists so that I don’t have to tell my adhd doc anything about my other mental issues. I‘ve even stolen meds from my mother. I know that’s horrible. 

I was taken off them recently when I was hospitalized for a week in a psych ward for my depression and it was horrible. I wanted to sleep all day and eat crap. I had no motivation for anything and felt horrible about myself and my life and my future. I begged my doctor to let me have my ADHD meds. But they wouldn’t. All I couldn’t think about was how I couldn’t wait to get out of there and how I’d never be honest with doctors again because they would take away my amphetamines, the one thing that made me feel good. I lied and said I’d try to wean myself off them but the minute I got out of the hospital I took a vyvanse for the first time in a week and felt amazing. I was just pacing around listening to music and everything was beautiful again. 

I don’t know what to do with myself. I know this is bad and I’ve been bad. Part of my knows what I have to do but the other part of me says I can’t. I won’t survive it. And I’m too scared to tell anyone in real life because I’m afraid I’ll become fat, useless and suicidal if they take away my meds.

The crazy thing is that even with the meds my ADHD is very bad. I’m on medical leave this semester from college because I’ve not finished any of my classes. I stopped talking to my mom. I slept without any sheets on my bed for months. Didn’t do any laundry. I hyperfocus on all the wrong things. Docs think I might be bipolar. It’s one huge mess. 

I don’t expect sympathy and I’m so so so sorry for being part of the problem and perpetuating the stereotype. At the same time, addiction is also a mental illness, kind of like ADHD. And I really want to change. I just need a push. But I understand if you want nothing to do with me after reading this.",643,0.0,0,0.0

My problem right now, I’m back to that feeling I had the first 2 months of recovery that no amount of sleep being enough. I typically sleep 8-9 hours every night and sometimes nap on the weekends, but it’s definitely not the same sleep as when I was using. I used to be able to sleep through the night uninterrupted. Like, that out cold, nothing could wake me up, like a baby sleep. Since getting sober, I haven’t had a single night where I don’t wake up randomly at least 4 times. 
I guess I’m just feeling a bit defeated. Has anyone else dealt with this kind of thing? I feel like hearing that I’m not alone would help me relax a little. But right now I’m so f*cking tired its unreal.
I WILL NOT RELAPSE. But those intrusive thoughts saying, “You know you’d get good sleep if you just used again,” have been plaguing me lately.

I wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/d1khg6/getting_sober_starting_tomorrow_how_long_until_i/) about 5 months ago right before I got sober from a slew of drugs, and I wanted to post a brief update here. My main motivation for getting sober was because I wanted to try an MAOI for my depression, and unfortunately it didn't help, so I've been taken off of it. As soon as my psychiatrist made that call, I heard a voice in the back of my head tell me, ""This means you can start using drugs again."" 

I don't know if I want to stay sober. I didn't feel any better, and my brain is so fucked up from all the substance use that I still feel like I'm living in a dissociated fog. My depression is worse than ever, so I wonder: was it worth it? At least when I did drugs I would listen to music, journal, and enjoy myself. Now I just feel completely dead inside and have no motivation or attention span. I'd get it if I were 30 days in and feeling this way, but at 5 months in, I gotta say I'm disappointed that I never got that ""cloud nine"" feeling of clarity. 

So yeah. I successfully stayed off hard drugs for 5 months without going inpatient or getting help for substance abuse, but I'm tempted to start using again in a week when the MAOI is fully out of my system and it's physically safe to use again. I know I'm rationalizing a bad decision. I just want to feel better, even if only for a little while.",286,0.0,0,0.0

To fill that void in your heart

Bring colour back to your cheeks

And rebuild you part by part

I wish I could protect you enough 

Drape you in warm sheets of care

So the cold world wouldn't get to you

Of its cruelty you've had your share

I wish I could guide you enough 

Be your light on roads of recovery

I have to wear a mask of bravery

Losing you would be the death of me

I see the defeat in your eyes

But I promise a new sun will rise

Please take my hand,

I understand...

With you til the very end I will stand.

But the shifted eyes choke my breath,

Your heart still sways to the dance of death.

There are demons here that I can't see.

I couldn't save you,

I always knew.

612,addiction,2020/02/05,"Stim (crystal meth) withdrawal question: If you have any stimulant or meth experience please read this and drop your opinion!

So, long story short I relapsed and have been on a sort of binge for the last 4 days. 
Haven’t really done a TON in this relapse—I’d estimate I’ve shot about 1.25g - 1.5g across like 4 days (basically like one shot per day of about 300mg or 0.3g, plus one extra somewhere)—although the effects of the crystal are naturally more noticeable and intense given I had been clean from them. So, until this afternoon, I hadn’t really gotten any decent sleep. But I’ve kept up on my fluids better than usual and I’ve consumed a good amount protein / food in general compared to usual, etc. 

Withdrawal for me is a terrible thing. I don’t get why, but some others need to be on meth for a long period of time to get withdrawal... not me. I’m lucky enough to get it basically no matter how much I’ve done (possibly bc prescription meds I take). I’m a full time student, though, and I also work a part time job..... I literally can not afford to be bone-tired / so exhausted that I cannot function for like 7-10 days, I’ll fall too far behind and I’ve already had that happen before. Not fun. 

UltimTsly my question is: in addition to hyper-loading on protein (to encourage and allow my body / brain to start producing neurotransmitters like dopamine on its own again), plus vitamins and minerals (I usually buy some Ensure nutrition drinks), do you think it would be at all valuable for me to use adderall to sort of taper off? Here’s what I’m thinking:

I have a half of one adderall already and I also have a friend who is prescribed it and who would give me one or two more pills if I asked her (but she wouldn’t give me a lot, and I would explain why I need it—she is supportive). My thinking is that i can cut them in half to have a couple half strength addy to take on days 3, 4, 5 of acute withdrawal when the tiredness really gets me. Addy, being weaker but pretty similar to meth in pharmacology and mechanism of action, I am willing to bet would NOT get me high or really stimulate me as much as it would simply balance it out a little bit and help me feel “normal” and thus enable me to keep being productive and not fall behind. I’m hoping that a low addy dose can do this on the worst days of withdrawal. 

So... thoughts on the idea? I mean I’m pretty sure I’m going to try it but wanted to know if anyone had opinions first. Thanks for reading.",490,0.0,0,0.0
613,addiction,2020/02/05,"Am I addicted to my Adderall? Hello! 

I have been on Adderall for over 4 years for my ADD/ADHD.
It gives me energy and does definitely help me focus, it works with no doubt.

But recently, my mom has been worried about me, saying I'm becoming addicted.
In my head, I know how it could look like addiction, but I always play it off.

I will admit that I am dependent on Adderall, definitely. I feel like I can't do much without it.
When I am in control of dosing out my Adderall, I will almost always take an extra pill or two because I feel like they have worn off, when really they haven't.

Unlike most other addicts to this substance, it really does help me focus like it should. Of course I absolutely LOVE the euphoria it gives me, who wouldnt? But it also helps me a lot! 

I always have to take my adderall at an even time, going by 5's. Ex: 5:35, if I miss a minute, I'll wait till 5:40. 
After taking it, I always keep track of how much time has passed. When an hour passes, my mind tells me it has stopped working and worn off. 

Why I don't think I'm addicted is the fact I've been on this medication for almost 5 years, I've never wanted anything else or a higher dose  (unless it didn't work at all), i don't actively seek extra illegally or sneak extra pills when my mom keeps it. I don't crush or snort it to get an effect faster, or any of that. I take it orally, and use caffeine to boost it.
Maybe I'm just a caffeine addict? Haha! 

When I am unable to take my adderall, or run out early (which happens occasionally, not often), I never really get phased much. I don't go around looking for it, I dont freak out or anything, I just wait. Sometimes I will get annoyed or get upset, but as time passes, I'm okay. 

Since I assume most here have had addiction experience, I would love to hear what you all think! Is this dependence, or am I becoming addicted? 

I will add that i do not want to try an illegal drugs because of Adderall. I am fine with what I have and never seek a ""better high"", or that ""first high"", because I enjoy what I have. 

Additionally, my dosage currently is one 20 mg Adderall XR tablet in the morning, and two 10 mg IR pills in the afternoon/evening as a booster.

617,addiction,2020/02/06,"Just Wanted To Get This Off My Chest So I go to the Methadone Clinic 2 times a week and when I go I ride share with these Women and we've become really good friends. My one friend Tammy had two children and back in the early 2000s her 2 early teenaged children were killed by this woman who was drunk and high and somehow she got out of doing and jail time at all and just had to go to rehab and be on probation even though she 3 people (the guy driving the car that was hit was Tammy's Friend). You can imagine what that did to my poor friend Tammy.. This is why she actually got started and got hooked on opiates in the 1st place. Well this woman also goes to our clinic and everytime she see Tammy she walks past her, looks her dead in the eye and smirks. It is the most cold fucking disrespectful cunt ass shit I have ever witnessed in my whole life. And she does this Tammy all the time. We were even in group one time and she was asked by the head nurse and the counselor to not go to the Friday group because that is the only group the people who ride with state transportation (us) have to go to. Well this bitch showed up anyway and looked at Tammy and smiled while she sat down and I had to take Tammy out of the room because she was about to hit her for smiling at her like that. And if she hits her she will be banned from the clinic. And even though she was asked not to go to the group she someone talked her way into being able to stay and Tammy and I just sat in the front while Tammy was crying her eyes out to the counselor. Well today the guy driving the van and to drop is off for 20 minutes and come back.. So me and Tammy are sitting inside because it's cold out and this Bitch walks in and Tammy started getting really upset. And I guess the girl didn't notice her at first so she didn't do her smirk thing. So I ended standing up between Tammy and the door so when she came out I could block her from seeing Tammy. So she came out and went to look at Tammy and started to do her smirk but instead I looked her dead in her eyes and she put her head down and walked put real quick.. Then I followed outside not saying anything and she about ran to her car.. And her boyfriend (who is also a pos) was still inside so she sat in her car. The other 2 women we ride with were outside smoking a cigarette and I walked up to them and told them what happened and I pointed at her and the other woman pointed at her too and we all turned and smoked (them a cigarette and me a vape) and mean mugged the shit out of her.. You could tell she was scared, like she thought we were going to jump her or something.. I don't know.. The whole situation made me mad a shit and I doubt that this minor incident will stop her from being a cunt and smiling at Tammy.. but every time I see her, I don't say anything, I just give her a cold stare. And now she has to go to the clinic everyday because she pissed dirty so poor Tammy has to see her almost everyday (because Tammy is newer to the clinic). Pieces of Shit like this give addicts a worse name. Like everything wrong I did in my addiction I  am truly upset about. This bitch has no remorse. Like Tammy even asked to talk to her for closure.. and she said I don't want to talk to that bitch.

620,addiction,2020/02/06,"It's not my problem. I can admit that I have a drug habit.  I can proclaim that I am a drug addict.  But it bugs me when people tell me I have a drug problem.  It's not a problem for me, it's a problem for them.  And when I tell them that I don't see my drug use as a problem... well, that usually doesn't go over well.  They are the ones who have a drug problem; they have a problem with people using drugs.  And now it's my problem and I need to fix it. 

I don't need these laws constantly over my head to function in a society.  I can see right through the illusion they've created to make themselves needed.  I don't need these laws to know what is right and what is wrong.  I have a simple rule I follow.  Is what I am doing harming anybody other than myself?  In my eyes there are lots of things worse than using drugs, things that are perfectly fine and dandy to do such as: lying, cheating on your significant other,  and deceptive manipulation. Hell, some of these harmful, hurtful actions seem like they are encouraged and celebrated by our society.  We're groomed to be addicts - money addicts.  Anything is ok as long as it's in pursuit of the all might dollar!!  Cha-fucking-ching.

What's worse, the drugs I had in my possesion, or the cops, testing me to see how well I knew my rights?  After seeing I did not know my rights, they proceeded to violate them, because they knew they could.  But I'm the bad guy? No one ever taught me my rights, imagine that!  My buddy got arrested for being homeless and incapacitated on bars.  They took the 300$ in drugs he had just purchased and 80% of the 300$ in cash he had ""for fees"". You know, the price of his luxury vacation behind bars.  He's still there.  And I suppose he's the criminal?  Yeah.... Right!  

I'm not stupid.  Does anybody really think that old white men would let the Mexican's run the show?  C'mon people... The US owns the Cartel.  They make all the money selling 'em to us, and then they make all the money arresting us and expecting us to pay $3,000 for a damn prescription pill? But I'm the bad guy... I'm the lowlife with the problem.  I don't have a problem,  I just live inside of a problem!  All the bad shit througout history is brilliantly orchestrated by the owners of this planet, corruption in pursuit of the all mighty, shitty, green paper with their faces printed on it. Distinguished by discreet reminders - remining us that they own us, and we had better act the way they want, and think the way they want - or else pay the fuckin price.

It's easy for non-addicts - they don't wanna use drugs!  Then they expect addicts like me to suffer through the rest of my days sober.  Fuck that. I habe a traumatized brain, it want's to feel satisfied as quickly as possible, and I comply.  Look, I'll admit that I could be better. I hate how selfish being an addict is, and I know it is not good for me spiritually.  The issue is that a lot of other shit isn't either.... but they pick on the addicts. Druggies are the lowest subset of people, it's encouraged to look down on druggies and treat 'em like shit.  I try to be good,  but you know they gotta be so damn expensive that life just becomes about losing everything just to get that next high... It consumes all the time I have just to get my next fix.  

It's not like I'm not functional. I can work, there's just no time. All day is a quest to get my next fix.  I smoke heroin and meth everyday for the last 3 years.

I highly recommend this miraculous medicine to anyone struggling with addiction. I was in a small clinic/hospital when I initially took the medicine (message me if you would like a reccomendation). There was one other person with me laying in the bed next to me. There's soft instrumental music playing and a projection of lights onto the ceiling as a light show just for amusement before we traveled out of our bodies. We took the initial dose two pills and waited twenty minutes until taking one more following another one after twenty more minutes. Right after taking the last pill I look over to my partner and ask if he feels anything he responds to me that he is unsure and raises his hand and puts it back down and at that moment his hand trailed in very slow motion. His hand had reached the bed but my vision was still catching up knowing then it was coming on and very fast and intense. I watch the lights in the ceiling as they are turning I see an African mans face come and go the face with tribal patterns would keep coming up eventually I decide to close my eyes and am thrown into this very speedy space with portals surrounding me in every direction I entered each portal each one seeing videos. Burning futuristic buildings in one. Myself robbing people and people deceiving me for money. One with homeless children begging me for help as I ignore them and continue to walk on. One where everyone I knew was watching me slam dope and crying in front of me. In each portal before I would leave i would experience feelings of near death. My thoughts are racing and the images come to me at a million miles an house although it wasn't just images. In each portal I was overwhelmed by each of these feelings: fear, greed, selfishness, shame, and anger. When experiencing all of this it feels like an intense buzzing and computer chip is plugged into your mind. My experience with visuals lasted about 10 hours and after that it was still lasting effects such as overwhelming feelings and information flooding my mind for another 3 days very slowly coming down I was unable to stand  for about 24 hours until after ibogaine and did not get any sleep for 80 hours after dose. After sleeping I did take DMT and did not experience any visuals just a release of all the fear I had inside of me. The ibogaine tore me apart and the DMT put me all back together.

I had only called them to see how my stepmom was doing, she has had some health issues, and had mentioned I was passing through to do a job.

I drive a suburban and he was driving a brand new Cadillac. My car absorbed it like a fucking champ and saved me from serious damage.

628,addiction,2020/02/07,"Day 1, part 2 I tried to shower but was unsteady on my feet. I soaked in the tub instead. I couldn't gather the strength to wash my hair. *pathetic*

I'm thinking of this weekend, tomorrow, when I have to tell my girlfriend, the love of my life, that I've been using again... I don't know what she'll say or how she will take it, if she'll leave me for good this time... But if I'm going to be in recovery and leave this poison behind, I have to start with honesty.

Back in November I was sexually assaulted by a coworker. I had been sober for about a month at that point. It hit me harder thna I expected, because it wasn't just about that one incident, it became about every incident that I experienced in my youth. Foster dads, foster brothers, my own grandfather.... Every thing came back in a flash, flood gates open, I began to drown. 

I decided to stand up for myself this time. I told my best work friend, who also happens to work in HR. She drove me to the hospital, I got a rape kit done, a cop came.. I repeated my story about 5 times that day, by the end of it, I was too exhausted to feel. 

It didn't end there, the next few days after I was torn in one direction after another. The detective, the hospital, my family, my support advocates, my girlfriend. Everything was just too much. By that thursday he was arrested. I felt better, safer knowing he couldn't hurt me. So I started to try and move past it. 

Fast forward to about 4 weeks ago, I get a call from his parole officer. She tells me he's getting out of jail, and will most likely stay out until the DA presses official charges, which may take months, even years.  That was the day I lost it. I went through about 20 people trying to find a new plug. And I did!

She dropped off what I had asked for, some crystal, and even though T wasnt my DOC I knew she'd take the pain away. And for awhile it worked. I became the most productive worker, I was finally able to balance chores and meetings and appointments. And I wasn't sleeping most days, which is the reality i wanted to avoid. I am terrified of my dreams, of being unconscious like I was that night that he raped me.... 

But I digress, it took 2 weeks for that stability to fall to pieces. On the end of week 2, i lost my job. It wasnt because of the drugs, but rather because I was a single mother of a child who has autism, my boss said they needed someone there who didnt have to leave work all the time for appointments or if my son was having a bad day... I was heartbroken about losing my job. I had been there for so many years, had poured so much effort and pride and passion into it, and it was gone. 

So for a few days after that I completely broke down, I used so frequently I almost lost my mind. Nothing could console me or make things better except for that next dose.... And then I looked at myself in the mirror, and I realised what I had done, and I decided enough was enough, I was done. Broken, and done. I portioned out the remaining crystal I had left into capsels. Each day would give me a lower dose. I quit chasing the crystal with H. i threw out my pipes and needles, hell even the tin foil. And so I began the process of ending this love affair. 

I took my last dose yesterday morning, I slept the majority of the day... And today I woke up and felt everything. 

For the first time in a month I felt my guilt, my shame, my failure. I felt the loss of my job, the possible loss of my relationship, the betrayal to my family and my friends and my children. This is the hard part.. 

I stood up earlier to take a shower, my first time moving all day, my bp crashed instantly, my world went dark... And all I kept thinking was that I hope it would stay that way.

He has used on and off again since I was a child.  I have always been aware of it.  He has a good job at the executive level in manufacturing.  My mom works as a nurse, so has the lower income.   They have more than enough money to cover expense when my dad is not using.  

He had a foot injury and was prescribed pain killers.  They move a lot, so this was a new doctor.  My mom came home one day to find a notice from the mortgage company on their door.  He admitted to my mom that he had a problem with pain medicine.  This has been going on for years, I think.  Being aware of his problems, I am hyperaware of his actions and I saw signs some time ago.  Apparently, he has dug them into a serious financial hole buying pain medicine (I'm not sure what else).  He is still working, but they cannot pay their bills. 

My mom is financially illiterate. He has always taken care of that. She got an account for her check, but I think he still can access it and is moving bills to her account.  I'm not sure of the details, but basically, my mom really needs my help.  BUT - she hasn't told my dad she told me and he hasn't told me either.  I have a new baby, and the stress of the secret and of the situation is really stealing my joy and causing me so much pain.   I want to confront him.  I want to see the finances and help my mom get it figured out.  I don't believe what he tells her and I am honestly terrified for her future (and his).  

He told my mom is he in an outpatient program with therapy and suboxone.  He has never hurt any of us, but does have anger issues (so does my mom).  I don't want him to hurt her or himself I confront him.  I don't know how to confront him -- email, in person, text?  I just feel trapped by it all and I am the primary caregiver for my baby so my time and emotional energy is limited.   Does anyone have any advice on how I should handle this? If it wasn't a financial issue, which is so personal, I feel like talking to him would be more about supporting him through this.

639,addiction,2020/02/08,"Preparing for an ayahuasca retreat made me turn away from my casual addictions and look harder at all my food choices I'm in my early 30s.  I have a good job that I work hard at, and I have a good reputation. I'm still renting, but I live comfortably and have enough space that I can host friends and family visiting.  In the meantime, the house is stocked with beer, bourbon, my diet is shit, and I got in the habit of drinking two or three cups of coffee-based drinks everyday.  That all contributed to a rise in my anxiety and irritability.  

I've been dealing with some pretty difficult stuff in my personal life since last fall. I signed up for therapy to talk through it, and went to ten sessions; sessions after that are more sporadic and about maintaining the gains you've made.  

In the meantime, I signed up for a retreat in Peru, where there will be three ayahuasca ceremonies, a San Pedro cactus ceremony, and a Sonoran desert toad session. A bunch of meditation and yoga and little hikes and health food and group talk sessions to discuss the experiences we have each night. In preparation for that, I have to adhere to *la dieta*.

*La dieta* is can be basically summarized by its limitations: no red meat, no sugar, no caffeine, no foods containing something called tyramine, no fermented foods, no pharmaceuticals, no psychoactive drugs.  You're supposed to eat mostly fruits and root veggies, with some grains.  If you don't adhere to the diet, you'll apparently have to purge during the ceremonies a lot more than somebody who strictly followed it.

You're supposed to gradually taper off of the things above.  Then in the week before your first ceremony, you really follow it completely.  This has been going on for about three weeks now. No beef or pork or alcohol.

It took me a week to taper off caffeine.  I've tried to do it a few times before, but knowing that I had this experience on the horizon and that I had already sunk a bunch of money into the trip definitely made me try a lot harder.  I went from two cups of coffee on Sunday, to one cup on Mon, Tues, Wed, to one cup of tea on Thursday and Friday, to half a cup of kombucha on Saturday and Sunday.  It's been six days without caffeine.  There were actually no headaches after the second day with tea. Super easy.  I think I notice the lack of energy in the morning before I eat, but overall, my mental faculties are all there, and my demeanor is a lot more pleasant and approachable.   

Breakfast has been mixed fruit with granola and yogurt. I removed the yogurt because dairy isn't really allowed either.  

Lunch has been veggies, potatoes or grains, and either fish or seitan/tempeh/tofu.

Dinner has been the most challenging for me, but it's normally been fish-based meals with veggies (nigiri and sushi rolls have been a blessing).  Or hummus with veggies.  Or nothing.  

No alcohol. No fried foods at all.  No deli meats.  No big meaty sandwiches.  No super sweet desserts. No really salty meals.

I expend more mental effort trying to find my food, but I'm also doing better all around. You adjust.  I started meditating every day.  Ten or 20 minutes at a time, in the morning and before I go to sleep at night.  I have yoga classes.  I've been working out more, and I've dropped some pounds from the diet.

I was so proud of myself! then BAM addiction to pills hit me and now ive of course been cut off because they only want you on those pain killers no more than 2 weeks for plastic surgery. Ive stopped pills and have moved onto Heroin non needle users BTW. I smoke it and have been doing that now for about 2 years. Im so ashamed but its true! I feel like a failure. So ive told you more than i probably really should but I feel like if anyone understands its got to be this group. So im curious as to how long you have been clean? Have you ever relapsed during that clean time? If so what kept you on track? etc Any helpful tips or encouragement would be appreciated. I hope all of what i said makes sense I kinda rambled a bit. But I really dont have many people to talk to about this. No longer have family and dont really have friends. Thanks so much guys and good luck on your Journey.",375,0.0,0,0.0

My cocaine addiction is paired with an gambling addiction so it's not just hurting me and mentally but also financially.

I’m a pretty straight-laced person. Barely consume alcohol, and the only illegal drug I’ve ever touched is weed in small doses. But my friends are telling me I might have an addiction to a prescription painkiller.

The painkiller is Zapain, a relatively mild (as far as I’m concerned) codeine/paracetamol tablet. I was prescribed them for back problems, which are caused by my job. They also are great for helping me fall asleep, as anxiety keeps me awake most nights.

I started off taking two only when I was in pain, to taking two per evening to help me sleep. From there I found they weren’t affecting me much anymore, and so I would take up to four per evening. I would go through a pack of 60 in about 3-4 weeks.

Now, I don’t feel like I have a problem. I’m not affected during the day. I’m not having moodswings, weight gain/loss, anything like that. My partner has noted that the only effect is that I’m sleepy and a bit dizzy. But when I casually mentioned to my friends that I take them every night, they became concerned that I’m addicted, and that they can damage my liver (?) FYI, none of them are medical professionals.

I don’t know what to think. And I don’t want to give them up because they benefit me so well (the only other thing that helped my pain/sleeplessness was weed, and that’s not legal in the UK).

Over the years, I managed to get my nicotine from 18 mg/ml (nicotine ammount of about 4 and 1/2 packs, 20 cigs each) down to 0. At various points during high school, I also battled alcohol addiction, and I was able to get rid of it as well.

My mom thinks that I´m on some sort of drug, and wants me to get drug tests, or else I´d get kicked out of here. For fuck´s sake, I´m just 19, and my mother wants to kick me out, because I´m fighting my nicotine addiction! She didn´t even believe me that I was a vaper, and kept telling me to get tested for drugs. 

I told her that I don´t have money for drugs, and I don´t know people who´d have them (even through my physical and personality traits mark me as someone, who gets easily addicted). I have only some online friends, and my LDR girlfriend, I don´t even leave this fucking appartment! I told her that it´s a waste of time, since I´m just going to waste money on doing test that will show her that I´m only having withdrawal symptoms from nicotine addiction, WHICH I ALREADY TOLD HER ABOUT.

 This weekend was a little different though. I felt anxious and just generally crappy and I had an intense urge to get high. The thought, instead of quickly fleeting, was burning through my mind.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel so lost, I have no self control. I’ve smoked weed nearly everyday for about 6 months. Smoking at school, when I wake up, before bed, I’ve been high all day so many times. I also used LSD pretty heavily from October to early January. Tripping from anywhere from 1 to 3 times a week. I stopped using after having mini panic attacks the day after tripping. I’m only 15 and I’m afraid I’ve fucked myself up. I can’t stop smoking I have no self control. I know what it does to a developing brain, but I just can’t stop. I used to just not care at all, but I’ve realized my problem and want to stop. I always tell myself I’m going to stop after I smoke what I have, but the second I get some money I can’t control myself and I buy more. It’s to the point where my dad gave me lunch money for school and I spent it on weed. I don’t even want to be high, it just feels like I need it. I can’t sleep without it, and now I convinced my mom to take me to see a doctor so I can get some kind of benzo that I’ll probably abuse as well. I know it’s wrong, I want to stop so bad, but I don’t think I ever will. I always tell myself I’m gonna stop, and I do if I have no money. Sadly the second I get an opportunity to smoke I do. Then after I smoke and sober up I just feel like shit and regret it. I want to talk to my parents and get them to help me quit, but part of me is still mad at them for things they’ve done in the past.

My dad began drinking heavily, but I stayed with him rather than my new abusive stepdad. I started stealing my dads cigarettes at 8, and I immediately fell in love with the buzz. I would have people buy me Marlboro red shorts at 9. Somehow I ended up huffing gasoline just weeks after. I loved it. Did it everyday between 4th and 5th grade summer. I wouldn’t hang out with friends so that i could be with my real friend; gasoline. This led to me; being white af, joining a small gang of delinquents called GD FOLK. I was beat in and eventually was dealing the new K2 spice. And then I was smoking K2 from 10 to 12. Eventually, my parents would end up back together when I was 12. I only chewed tobacco on occasion during this time. Then I decided to smoke my moms weed that was in her bedroom. I got super faded and played nba 2k, uneventful, but quickly spiraled into a 9 year weed addiction. I’ve done every psychoactive substance besides actual heroin and meth in excess before the age of 16. I fell into a depression and confided in a counselor who really helped me. I suffered through high school with drinking and smoking weed everyday afterwards. Other drugs; benzos, adderall, percs were all taken by me when they came around. I have always been smart, but I started to apply myself my senior year and scored better than 86% of students nationwide on the SAT. I became addicted to Kratom while studying for that. I got into a good college and still smoked weed everyday, and then after freshman year my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died unexpectedly from an aneurysm 5 months later while heading into remission. I was in history class when it happened. since his diagnosis in May of 2018, I haven’t been sober a day. Always on something. Still making good grades, but can’t hold down anything as I’m very unreliable with my addiction. I just don’t see me coming out on top of this.",467,0.0,0,0.0

Since your arrival, you have brought joy into my life. I am ever so proud of you. You're changing so quickly that every time I see you you know a new word or can answer a new question or can achieve a new physical goal. You make me smile and laugh and I enjoy our every moment together. I love you in a way I've never loved anyone or anything before.

And I worry with good reason. But when -- if -- I wake up tomorrow, I will have more reason to be hopeful than I have for 6 years. Tomorrow I take serious steps towards a change.

Son, I write you this letter as a solemn promise. I promise to grasp tomorrow's opportunities and do everything in my power to break this cycle.

I recognise how deeply trapped I am though, which is why I left this letter with your aunt in the event I do not make it.

690,addiction,2020/02/11,"Trying to get through the day (day 4 of no cannabis) I'm sure my problem is insignificant compared to others on this sub, but I need to cope somehow.

I've been taking cannabis every day for three years now. I got a medical certificate for a seizure disease. It's currently undiagnosed, and I've had a lot of tests to rule out what it isn't, such as epilepsy, a brain tumor, etc. Cannabis helps me with anxiety, but it can't be recommended for that reason in the states I've lived in. I was prescribed opioids (Xanax) for anxiety but I don't want to get physically addicted -- I was prescribed benzos for a while and getting off them was terrible. So I opted for cannabis as the lesser of two evils-- not that I really think cannabis is evil AT ALL. In fact, it's just prejudice that has kept it federally illegal all this time. 

So now I've moved to a new city with my husband for his job and I'm looking at getting a new job. My last job was at a university, where they did not care/ trusted me to manage myself like an adult. Now I'm applying for a job at a federal lab where drug testing is mandatory and required to get a clearance which is necessary to even work there. It's kind of a dream job -- at least, the salary is a dream salary lol. So now I'm 'studying' for the test and haven't taken any cannabis for four days. 

I quit nicotine about 10 years ago before getting pregnant with my first. So, I know I can quit this thing if I want to. And I quit those benzos too.

If I were working today, it wouldn't be so hard. I'd be away from home at the co work space, applying for jobs and working on my side projects. But it's a snow day and I'm home with the kids who are off school. I'm bored off my ass and want that distraction. I'm anxious and searching for relief.  If I were alone I'd go to sleep or something to blot out the day and let time pass while my body gets used to operating without it. I can't, though, due to kids at home. (Actually, having the kids around makes it a little easier/distracty-er. If I were alone I'd probably break and smoke.)

I don't have a plan to get through the day, except minute by minute. I feel blank and sad, and I know the way to feeling better is right there in the cupboard. 

Ugh. Help me hold out. I remember from quitting nicotine that the hardest days are the third day, the third week and then by the time you get to the third month you're free.

692,addiction,2020/02/11,"Having cravings for Ecstasy again Hi guys

I'm a 17 year old highschool student soon to graduate and move on to college. I'm also making music in my own home studio I've recently built for myself, working out, and working at a local bar doing dishes. I just barely pulled through highschool, as I failed my first 3 years getting F's in litterally every single class, got expelled, and fell into a dark path when I got addicted to chasing highs. Luckily, an alternative school helped me turn that all around and I'm now eligible to attend a community college and transfer to a bigger university. 

I recently just got sober, as the only thing I now consume is caffeine, which I eventually plan to quit too. Before that, it was cocaine, ecstasy, acid, marijuana, spice, alcohol, nicotine, porn. I had a pretty bad addiction to all these things. But I managed to finally get sober after 4 years of highschool and hell.

The last thing I've done was ecstasy 3 weeks ago. For some reason, ecstasy is my favorite drug out of them all. It wakes me up, makes me feel (of course) in ecstasy, went great with weed, and for some reason I would love watching porn hours and hours on end while doing lines.

Last time I did ectsasy I nearly overdosed. I managed to snort 6 very strong pills that were also laced with cocaine and other filler drugs. It was honestly the highest I'd ever been in my life. 3 days after I became a huge fiend, searching my carpet for pill residue I accidentally spilled and getting high as fuck (even though my tolerance skyrocketed very quickly). I finally kicked it on the 4th day after doing it, but life felt like hell afterwards.

Then I finally decided to quit weed, porn, and nicotine cold turkey as-well as any other drugs I tried occasionally. It's now 3 weeks since I've done ecstasy, and 1 week since being 100% sober. Life is boring as hell, but I already see myself becoming so much more productive and successful.

But I still feel empty, lethargic, and bored with life. The longest I've been sober is 1 month in the past 4 years. But luckily, I've cut out all my toxic friends.

But today, my brain is having flashbacks to doing the ecstasy. I had a dream last night about doing a shit ton again and having a huge porn binge. And I even overdosed in the dream. It was scary and blissful at the same time, and I accepted that I was about to die in my dream. Then I woke up.

But even after the overdose in my dream, I've been craving X super hard today. I keep on getting flashbacks to snorting all those pills and feeling invincible while watching hours of porn. And it makes me want to do it again. I have no cravings for any other drug besides this one. 

Shit is really f\*cking with my head. I work out and make music to help get through the cravings, but even after all this I'm still craving it pretty hard. I'm half tempted to hit up my dealer and buy a shit ton of X pills. Can someone help talk me through this or give me advice, please? I want to be sober and stay sober and be like that for the rest of my life. I'm tired of chasing highs. But my brain can't help but want one last time.",606,0.0,0,0.0

He puts me in these traps where he says wants to be the person I go to when I’m weak or not okay, but then he makes me feel like I’m asking for too much. He makes me feel like his life is harder with me.

698,addiction,2020/02/11,"Just a thought, please weigh in I’m unsure of what defines an addict. Whether it’s the dependence of being on that substance, going to extremes to ensure you can get your next fix or putting yourself into compromising situations to enable yourself to use. I do not know. There’s a lot of factors to weigh in. 

I do not know if I’m an addict, maybe just by debating it I’m admitting I am no matter the functionality. However, what I do know is that I’m ready to fulfil the absence inside of me with something meaningful instead of with a substance. Something I can harness or invest myself into, build my foundations upon and become the person that I want to be. The difference I want to see in the world. 

At some point in your life you need to decide what you stand for and what you hold dearly to you. I know I cannot help anyone else if I cannot help myself. From what I can see the world needs more people who can love unconditionally, the world needs people who can forgive mistakes and the world needs people who can be selfless. 

The day a man plants a seed knowing he will not bask in its shade is the day we’re making the right decision not only for ourselves but for the people we hold close to our hearts. 

So many people are brought up believing they have to change the world, they have to be the next big doctor or surgical consultant, or a MP
Or senator. No you do not have to change the world. All you have to do is change the world of others around you, if you make 1 person smile just once and impact their day positively then that person may come into contact with 10 more people and impact their lives positively. Then those ten people may spread that smile and before you know it just your decision to make someone smile has improved 100 other people’s lives. In just one day. 

What will you do today to make someone smile? Don’t answer just ask yourself.

I never used longer than two days in a row. Never went on a bender.  I don't have any physical withdrawals whatsoever. Usually, I just do 3-5 lines and stop at it. I don't even think about doing it most of the time.   
But every time we gather with friends, it only takes a couple of drinks and we start looking at each other and without saying anything we all already know what we are going to be doing. And in the next few minutes, someone calls a dealer. And it feels so special, being surrounded by all these beautiful, smart, successful people, talking for hours on end, joking, laughing.

A month maybe, or two. Then maybe I can indulge in some more. Just a little bit. What's a point in life if you don't allow yourself little pleasures?  Next time I go out, I'll just have a glass of wine, will enjoy being around people, talking to them, dancing to some music. 

But it just doesn't work for me anymore. Every time I am going out, I just feel empty. Music doesn't sound good, drinks don't taste good, I don't feel like talking to people.

I had a long week, I did a lot, I deserve it. I did not ask for it, but since I am being offered, I won't refuse."" And almost every time it happens.   


Literally everyone in my social circle does it. Friends, colleagues.  It is everywhere. It feels like no escaping from it. And I am sick and tired. And angry.

But with social media and games, it's so different. It's so easy to pick up when you're at home and have nothing to do for an hour, fast forward a month and I'm neglecting my friends hobbies and responsibilities to progress in a game, or I rather scroll through Facebook for an hour just to ""not do"" some important stuff.
I know it's dopamine related, all games nowadays are total dopamine IVs, once you start everything else feels bland and boring, and you don't progress fast enough to keep you interested. So even if I play a bit, slowly but surely I get into the game and other stuff fades to the background.
When I think of quitting cold turkey I feel immense anxiety that I will feel bored forever, but I feel guilty after spending yet another day on the bad habit. 

How do I take control of this? I don't want to quit, I want to control it, to be able to relax after a long day with an hour of gaming, and then pick up something else and actually feel good about.

For a few months I’ve been in trouble.
Been having flashbacks of sexual trauma. I was abused a lot as a kid, one of my coping mechanisms was to “like and invite” the abuse.

As an adult this led to a sex addiction. Always me allowing others to use me. 

I’m married now, and I have a wonderful home and a beautiful family. My partner is the most amazing person in my life I’ve ever known.

The past few weeks have been getting worse and worse and several days ago I collapsed and let myself be in a situation where someone used me.

Halfway through it I snapped out of it and stopped and ended it and left. This all happened within a minute.

It was without a condom, and now a million things are running through my mind.

I can’t get tested for another 6 days, and then the results will take a week or two. I also have to test again in 6 weeks to see if I got herpes. It doesn’t help that the clinic told me that local sti numbers are increasing every year.

They told me if I have something... I’m already contagious.

I feel sick to my core. I keep thinking about what I may have just done to the people I care for.

I can’t stand the idea that I betrayed my partner, that now there’s a chance I’ll have to come forward and break their heart, and I know in doing so I will lose my family.

All for something I didn’t even want. I just re-enact the  harm that was done to me as a child, and I thought I had it under control but it seems like I don’t.

I keep thinking “this is it. This is how everything ends.”

No one knows about my sex addiction, just my therapist.

I have always tried to be the best person I can be for my partner and for my little family, I never wanted to hurt them or myself.

Every single second I keep thinking about the what if’s, and what will happens. I keep thinking that I’m a horrible person for allowing this to happen.
Everything in my life was going better for me, really better... and now I may have just ruined all of that.

I’m scared because if this turns out bad, I know I won’t survive this. I won’t be able to live with myself.

I never wanted this, and now I have to prepare for the fact I may have just destroyed everything good in my life.

I survived years of trauma and abuse, and now that I’m free from it I’m traumatizing and abusing myself.

Unable to stop, unsure of what else to do, and allowing my depression to take the wheel, I’m caught in a cycle of self destruction. I’ve been numbing away all the emotions. Not just the terrible feelings and shit I don’t want to deal with, but also my light and everything that I know I can be. 

I am so scared of facing my demons without anything to hold onto. But it just simply isn’t possible for me to continue smoking and to simultaneously heal.

I haven't seen him in 2 months, but I recently learned that he's in a bad way; he's really, really sick and lost everything in his life aside from drugs and his multiple sexual partners that provide him drugs/money. He's done some things to really hurt people that he's known for over a decade, and has lost the vast majority of the HUGE support system that he had. 

I reached out to him shortly after learning this because I'm a dumb ass. It was mostly just me pleading for him to get help, which was useless. He said things that I believe he just thought I wanted to hear (I still love you, I'm sorry, I'm having regrets, etc.), but his primary message was that we need to move on (not unwise) and that this is ""what"" he is. What does that mean? ""This is what I am"". I'm having a hard time grasping it. 

I have been 6 years sober and when I was an addict, I did terrible things. I had this constant ache/need for attention and stimulation; I did a lot of fucked up, unforgivable things and hurt a few people--including myself--in pursuit of that. After 6 years, I don't recognize that person anymore. I've realized that who I was then was just an amplification of my own issues, but I've worked through most of those while sober and can't even remember what that mindset felt like.

At the age of 18 I went and spent the summer in a party island in Europe and worked there. I have since done that twice. There is a huge drug culture there and I got myself into habits of sniffing ketamine and cocaine pretty much all day everyday as I had access to large amounts it was never a issue financially. I was there for 6 months and had around 4 days I did not get on it over that period. So that happened for two summers and I have recently returned to England.

Then back surgery at 19 had me on opiates for years and years and my doctor would always write my prescription and would up until about 6 months ago (I am 31 now) 

Left college and took a break from them. Then my father was getting prescribed them from back surgery and then a knee replacement and I would take some of his pills without him knowing because I knew he got then every month. Felt awful doing it but I still did it.

Fast forward to when I was 25 and my father passed. Really rough time in my life and went back to get doctor to prescribe me and then went to the dark web to get more (and I still am doing it now) and it's just always been a part of me for the last 11 years.

If you care to read it, let me know what you think. Thank you

“This is all from the heart, I want you understand what you’ve been through and how it’s affected you and why you use drugs to numb your pain

1. Lifelong trauma from your mom and family

2. Doc shoving pain meds down your throat at an adolescent age where your brain is barely over half developing 

3. Continued (chronic) stress and PTSD from trauma caused by mostly your mom but the rest of your family likes to contribute to that.

4. Growing up around drugs &amp; alcohol and seeing it from a young age.

I don’t blame you for the way you think, it’s literally not your fault. your brain development was hindered all throughout your life. Your brain chemicals have been imbalanced, and those pain meds the doctor gave you back then only fueled it. Your brain has been wired wrong since probably before you made it to middle school. That’s why you make impulsive decisions, that’s why you get excited when you see drugs. You had bad influences your whole life, that took advantage of your naive young mind for their own advantage. Connections in your brain literally aren’t connecting where they would in a “normal” brain, and some connections are being made where they aren’t supposed to be. That’s why everything “wrong” with you is “wrong”. 

Do you remember the first time you used any form of drug to cope with mental hurt? It was probably weed. From the first time you did that your brain realized “hey, this helps my pain more than anything else I’ve tried, even crying or venting to someone or anything else that’s healthy” ; right there your brain rewired itself without you knowing, subconsciously. And the more you fed it, the worse it got. Your brain can be your worst enemy, and it’s not even your fault because it’s subconscious and you don’t know it’s happening, but it is.

You are a product of your environment, just like I am. I started smoking as a social thing with my sister, but when I got stressed or sad or angry I knew that weed helped me feel happy, so I smoked it to help my pain. Honestly weed IS a gateway drug, for those who have been traumatized mentally. It’s a new coping mechanism, and it works. Yeah weed it’s great for a while, but eventually it won’t help like it used to. You build up a tolerance and without it, your emotions are even worse. Then you realize “hey, maybe this pill or this alcohol will do a better job at helping with my emotions because weed isn’t cutting it anymore” that’s how some people like me and you get into other drugs, we’re just trying to cope with emotions the only way our brains know how. 

When I think about coke, or if it’s even mentioned, my brain and body perks up, excited, even though I didn’t do it for that long, and didn’t do big amounts. I literally SMELL the cocaine when that happens, it’s haunting. It’s my mind playing tricks on me, because it wants it so bad. My brain wants to be happy, to feel good, drugs are instant happiness, my mind is gonna choose drugs over everything when it knows how easy drugs make me feel better. That’s how the brain works, it’s all chemicals, and guess what else is chemicals? Every single drug. But the happiness is only temporary, and when it wears off, it leaves your brain freaking out to feel good again when the emotions come flooding back.

You did nothing wrong, you are not 100% to blame. The people and influences you were around growing up are to blame. You are doing what humans are MADE to do, cope with stress. You followed your natural instinct just like everyone else. Drugs are just the worst way to do it, because of all the negatives and dependency and addiction. It’s like a slide, you start at the top, but it’s only downhill from there.

This is why I’m studying and majoring in psychology, so I can learn to rewire my brain and control it, instead of letting it control me. I want to help people understand and overcome their addictions or emotions or whatever else they’re mentally dealing with, before it’s too late. I’m sorry it took a while to type”",826,0.0,0,0.0

My friend (23) has been heavily addicted to benzodiazepines for over 4 years now. And not only those, he's probably used and mixed every hallucinant drug under the sun. I want to do something because i can't bear to see him in this state but i'm completely incompetent and know nothing of drugs or addiction. I need to say that he's not a really close friend, more someone who i happen to know. I'm trying to stay in touch with him, he basically has no social network and our contact is reduced to online contact (social anxiety got him on xanax in the first place).
 
Now it's not like he hasn't considered quitting himself, he did actually quit for a few times in the past years, never longer than a month though. But the argument he makes is that life is Just incredibly better on drugs for him, je says that all activities in our lives are aimed at making is feel good, and he's doing it in the most effectieve way.  To me he said:

""Drugs prove that happiness, success, motivation etc are all hormone/chemically controller, it's out of your controll. For me drugs are immeasurably better than real life. Without it, I'm eternally bored, soulless, obese and there is no reason to live.""

I don't know what to say, i mean, I don't think it's possible to change someone's will but besides, doesn't he kind of have a point? 

With his current lifestyle, i don't see him reach 25. All mind altering substances combined with alcohol, no social life and depressive thoughts will bring him down quickly. He doesn't care if he dies soon, doesn't care about anything but his drugs tbh.

I however do care, a lot. I am very concerned and I'm not giving up hope yet. I know he's in need of professional help but what can i say, how can i reach out to him? I have to note that I am unable to see him in real life these days, the distance is frustrating me.

736,addiction,2020/02/13,"Am I broken? Not exactly sure how to start this so I'll just dive right in. I'm a 19 year old male, currently in college. I've been smoking weed daily for the last 3 year. 
I've tried to kick the habit so many times. Honestly, for the last year or so I've probably tossed my stash once a week, promising myself I'll be a new person the next day, only to cave and text my dealer after a few hours of sobriety. They say it isn't addictive, but I feel so lost and empty without it. The longest I've gone since I started is about a month. I hoped that eventually I'd forget about weed, learn to live without it, but even then I still felt the craving, and eventually I fell right back into my addiction. 
I guess I've been using it as a coping mechanism. I don't exactly like myself; I'm lazy, self absorbed, insecure, etc. It's sort of a self fulfilling prophecy though--i hate myself so I smoke to forget about myself, but I also hate that weed has so much control over me, which just makes me hate myself even more.
Thinking back to before I started smoking, I've realized that I've always abused different outlets to disconnect from the world. During middle school, I'd watch like 8 hours of TV a day, just trying to forget what real life was like. Not that it was terrible or anything--honestly, I had a fine childhood (good parents, good friends). But there has always been this internal voice telling me how shitty I am, so leaving myself behind always seemed like the best solution. High school it was video games, then partying, then smoking with friends, then just smoking by myself. I never really learned how to actually live, bruises and all. I've always taken the easiest route, leaving when things get too tough, and now I'm scared that it may be too late to develop the proper habits.
Another big problem is that, though it has a huge effect on my internal balance, it hasn't really impacted my external self. I get good grades, my parents don't know I've ever smoked. When it comes to most things, I'm a fully functional stoner. 
A few months ago I was really determined to stop smoking so I asked my roommates to help me quit. They were very supportive, and for a few weeks it went fine. Eventually, though, I fell right back into my old habits. I was so ashamed. I'm still ashamed. And I didn't tell them. So that's where I'm at now: still smoking near daily, even though my best friends think I've been sober for months. It feels disgusting. 
I just can't control myself. I don't know how.

How can I fix myself? Am I fixable? It is crazy how such a puny substance can have such a large impact on me. But jesus, I need help.",522,0.0,0,0.0

At first when she told me I thought, “ well maybe it’s not going to stick around and it would just be one time.” I think everyone who has an addict in the family hopes it would just be one last time , but it obviously wasn’t the last time. She’ll come home smellling like alcohol already and tries to cover up the smell with mints. That almost never works because whenever I smell mints coming off her breath, it’s now trying to hide the smell. Why try and hide it ? Because she’s an addict and she doesn’t wanna admit to anyone she fell off. Here’s a little backstory; In 2014 I think , is when she had weight loss surgery. She had the gastric sleeve operation where they cut out 84% of her stomach. She ended up losing a ton of weight and the drinking wasn’t so bad . That summer of 2015 was so fucking bad . She started partying more and more with friends and now family could see it was a problem . She ended up gaining a lot of weight that summer from drinking so much . She could easily finish at this point ( after surgery remember) 2 full sleeves of fireball , a four pack of wine, beers and more on top of that. That’s exactly what she drank the night before I had to drive her to the hospital. She couldn’t keep anything down, because her liver was the size of a football, and her body didn’t want anything except liquor . Her body ended up turning yellow. She missed my first day of senior year because she was in the hospital because her habit almost killed her. And now she yells at me when I bring it up to her or try and talk to her . She gets so mad because she “ knows what she’s doing “ , she’s “an adult” , she “ knows how much of an asshole she was she was drinking abut swears she would never be as bad again”. She yells at me almost every night, I can’t even talk to her without her getting mad at me or slurring her words . Sometimes it feels like she hates me or resents me when she’s drinking. Before she got sober , we didn’t get a long at all and then she became sober which in turn our relationship got better , but now it’s going down the tubes. I’m almost 23 and I need to get the hell out of my house . I wanna get away from her but I love her so much .... I’m scared she’s going to end up almost dyeing again, getting in a car accident because she was too drunk to drive , or just scared of the fact her heart might just stop beating ... apart of me feels better for expressing how I feel, but apart of me feels like shit . :/",501,0.0,0,0.0

**Pain**

”Take a piece” she said to me,  
“I promise I’m your friend “  
Calmness, peace, and happiness, no doubt a true godsend  
“Anxiety’s my middle name,”  
“I don’t know who I am”

Life has been so hard for me  
And this shit is my jam  
She said she’d never leave me  
But she wanted me to die  
I had a life, my future bright  
My head stuck in the sky

Her blanket sewn by satan’s hands  
Stayed draped around me tight  
She held me close  
And whispered soft  
(Stay here you’ll be alright)

They taste so good I couldn’t stop  
It’s one it’s two it’s three  
False confidence and slurring words  
Why can’t she leave me be?  
She took my pep she took my step  
Is this what they call death?  
I’ll have you know there was a time  
She even took my breath  
I ran to him and told him  
Knowing he won’t understand  
I hurt him worse than she hurt me  
And that was not my plan

He’s crying in his room alone  
It’s taken an extreme  
The man I loved so deeply  
Felt like nothing but a dream

I wish he knew the pain I felt  
When looking in his eyes  
See that’s the thing that stupid bitch  
She taught me how to lie

But what went wrong?  
I asked myself  
How did I get so lost?  
I never loved myself enough  
And now I pay the cost

That precious brown haired little girl  
Her big eyes filled with tears  
What’s wrong with me?  
She thought all day  
So different from her peers

Why do I care, why do I feel  
This shit is way too much  
They’re mean to me, I’m way too fat  
I couldn't eat my lunch

My tears turned into anger  
And my anger soon to rage  
I’m done with Xans, I swear I am  
It’s time to turn the page

Since then I’ve told them everything  
Thank God for honesty  
Her knife’s no longer in my back  
(She left me there to bleed)

But hear me out, I lost control  
I didn’t have a choice  
She said she’d be my closest friend  
Then robbed me of my voice

I kicked her to the curb  
And while her damage is still done

759,addiction,2020/02/15,"Not sure where to go next My partner is addicted to coke, and without going into a whole history of his life, he started smoking weed as teenager to cope mentally with an abusive and broken childhood. We've been together since teenagers and are now in our 30's with 2 kids and a house. Its only in the last few years that the addiction has escalated into an issue. He's always used something weed/coke/alcohol/pills etc but its always been in a way that can be explained as casual. Although, I believe the addiction has always been there. I've been supporting him about 4 years, with him only admitting and trying to deal with the addiction properly the last 2 years.

I'm someone who copes quite well with stress and can generally keep my cool, but the selfish behaviour has really driven me to a place where i'm just lost as to what I can do. He's very open about his issues and has made steps to get better e.g. couselling/drug support groups/anti depressants (spent about 6 months sober last year), but this swings so widly. I really struggle with certain decisions that are made that put him straight on the route to getting drugs. Plus money is a massive issue, He knows he can't be trusted with it so I manage it and often have to lie to him about whether or not we have money. But then obviously theres only so much of that I can do, as it becomes obvious we have money when we go to buy food/petrol etc.

We've sat down and discussed boundaries before but at the moment he's in such a bad place, none of that is being met. So much money has been spent that we are way into an overdraft and can't really afford even the essentials until we get paid. It may be hard to believe but despite the money and addiction issue we actually have a really great relationship and when he's out of actively using he's a completely different person.

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for, other than maybe some words of support, perhaps if you have any hope for me/or you think I'm clearly blinded by the situation. I don't want to just give up on him, so much of what he went through as a child is really quite unbelievable and he's always sort of been abandoned. The problem is its affecting me significantly now. I have recently developed quite high anxiety and panic attacks. I'm not sleeping and over the last few weeks have come out with a stress rash and have a constant twitchy eye!

I don't really confide in anyone close to me with the details, as they don't truely understand addiction and would automatically pit him as the bad guy and suggest breaking up with him as the only option. I get that may be the case, I'm just hoping someone can give me some unjudgemental options as to what I should be doing.

This is the longest he has been sober and hasn’t relapsed in over 8 years. He was mainly addicted to meth but also used coke and is still triggered by weed (he last smoked this past august). 

Anyhow, since he has been sober he has accomplished so much and I’m beyond proud of him. For the first year that he was sober I would give him a little gift on the sobriety date each month and for his one year sobriety and I got all of his friends and family to make a video saying how proud they are of him and the compilation lasted about 45 minutes and he loved it.

He says he doesn’t follow the date of his sobriety (so I kind of feel like it matters more to me than him?) but anyway he’s going to start a new job soon where he’s going to be working a graveyard shift 12am-8am 5 days a week and then has one school from 9am-12pm and then the other 4 days a week 6pm-11pm. 

While I’m thrilled he will finally have a job in a field he enjoys, I am nervous about this schedule affecting his sobriety. When he worked in fast food he used to help him power through graveyard shifts and I’m terrified he will feel tempted to start using again.

It was easier to be there, and to be supportive when we lived in the same town. We saw each other more frequently, and when he was feeling really distressed we would sit, smoke cigarettes, cry, complain, etc. I live about an hour away now. We talk somewhat frequently but he isn't one to reach out or vent. There are a few family members who (imo) he had unhealthy relationships with that he leans on. They go back and forth between enabling and their interpretation of ""tough love,"" which is just being abusive and mean. 

I don't know how to reach out and be there. He's in rehab now, I talked to him just a few days ago, and he didn't mention a thing. I do not struggle with addiction, just other issues, so I get the desire to just want to hide when everything is really bad, and not let on that you're having a hard time. I know when I open up to people about my issues,or even just if they become aware of them, my family tends to focus on it and never drop it. To the point of bringing shit up I'm not thinking about, I'm doing fine, and they make it all about my problems. I don't want him to feel like people are just worried and concerned constantly and don't see him as a person outside of his addiction if that makes sense. We talk about shit but I don't want to bug him and be like... ""Hey how you feeling how's the drug thing going want to talk about that?!"" and remind him of it if he's doing well, but he hides it so well that I never know what's going on.

Moving from a mech mod with no nicotine to a big box and tank mod with 3 mg of nic then up to 6 nicotine fast. Then the blu disposable pens, then onto the juul wave where i got into that and was there for awhile. Inbetween i smoked some black and milds but never really cigarettes. 

Today im deciding to stop, its been every day since my first vape at 15 where i had no clue what i was entering. Would love encouragement, advice, support.

778,addiction,2020/02/16,"Five Year Celebration - Words of Gratitude  Dearest friends,

Five years ago today, I stumbled into the rooms

And today I am writing to express my gratitude

My life is evidence that miracles are possible

&amp;#x200B;

In 2015 I was 21 years old and I had had enough

Of bipolar disorder, resentment and vomit

Of broken glass, ashes and loneliness

But lacking courage to end my life

&amp;#x200B;

So I made my first meeting, took the first step and set fire to my old self.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few years the time spent in these rooms has taught me:

* When uncomfortable or stressed blank –Be patient. **Comfortable silence** **resides within**.
* When failing or controlling – Accept. **Let go**. **Or you will be dragged. Friction burns.**
* When self-centered – Humility. Every time. **Always be kind. No exceptions.**
* When the path feels hard, tread lightly. **If it’s not effortless, it’s not right.**

&amp;#x200B;

With discipline, I have been given the courage to rebuild my life with intention

And in exchange for faith, I have been granted an existence of belonging and serenity

&amp;#x200B;

Brothers and sisters, from love we come and to love we shall return

Blessed is each fighter that has passed and each still to come

That no addict seeking recovery should ever die

&amp;#x200B;

And if you would like to celebrate with me today, smile.

I don’t know how to help him so I was hoping for some advice here. All our friends are getting increasingly worried about Jimmy but don’t know how to approach the situation. 

Jimmy has been “trying to tamper off” for the last 12 months however, has been bed ridden and “doesn’t have enough energy to get out of bed which means he can’t completely quit”. 

Seems like he has a cycle of excuses. Not enough energy so can’t leave house or get a hobby, needs to use cause he will be too anxious/fatigued/etc. 

Jimmy is a very smart guy (Uni graduate and worked as a professional for 5 years in his field). He has been out of work for the last 12 months to get clean, he lives with his mum and does nothing all day besides laying in bed tampering himself off aka using. Jimmy is self aware enough to know that he needs to get off it ASAP and how bad it is for him. 

All of our close friends have used drugs recreationally since we were 15 (mdma, lsd, Coke, flowers, etc - we’re all now now 28, professionals that occasionally still party) so we’re not completely green to how delicately something like this needs to be handled. But none of us have been addicted to something as hard as this so we don’t know how to help.

Jimmy recently told me he needs someone to hold onto his gear and ration it out to him as he can’t do it himself. This made me more concerned than ever before. 

We love Jimmy and desperately want to help him but we have no idea what to do. Any links or advice would be greatly appreciated. thanks in advance xo",327,0.0,0,0.0

I am supposed to take 450 mg of Wellbutrin (Bupropion) each day. Just in six hours I've tripled that number.

It started when I moved up from 300 mgs. It made me feel really anxious and shaky, so I went back with the normal 300 mg dose. After a while, though, I started to get tired. Like, really really tired. I was so exhausted I could barely do what I needed to do, let alone to succeed in any way. On a whim, I decided to start taking 600 mg to help. It really has, but now I find myself craving more. It sucks because nothing beats that first-time misery, but I keep upping it to try to go there again (I have about 2 months of extra meds I didn't take). I'm having a really hard time right now, so I feel like I need it just to do stuff.

I heard recently on the news that it's being used as a street drug (injected) but leaves really nasty scars.

He reached out clearly looking for help, but has overdosed on benzos and other drugs and taken himself to the hospital twice in the last 24 hours.

Today it is not. I've had an addiction since I was 11 years old. My parents and rest of my family may not want to hear this. You might get pissed. Well, this is not about you! So, shut the hell up and listen... 

   I've done many drugs. One thing I had never considered an actual drug... Weed. I have smoked weed basically every day since I was in 6th grade. I've quit two times for only a small amount of time. I've never thought of weed as an addiction because I've done it for so long. It was just how I lived. I've done so many drugs and large amounts of most of those drugs. I'm not proud that I did them, but I am proud that I stopped doing them. I do not care if any of you are not proud.. or if you are proud. This is not your life. It is mine. I quit smoking cigarettes about 3 years ago and thought ""Wow!! I quit smoking God damned dirty cigarettes!?""... But I didn't quit smoking weed. My mind has been in so many bad places over the past 20 YEARS OF ADDICTION! February 11th was the last day of that! I’m not even thinking about weed which is incredible on its own. But I can literally FEEL my mind changing. I have a better view on life. I have a more open mind to things. Not a blurred vision of what I thought to be an open mind. I have been depressed since my friend David died when I was 8 years old. I’ve written about him a few times but always delete it. Weed was the answer. Until I realized I was just asking the wrong questions! If you don’t like hearing this, I’m sorry. If you’re my mom or dad, I’m sorry but I won’t talk to you in person about anything! I love you guys! But I’m living my life now! Finally actually living without any bullshit in the way! And Dad.... we spoke a few weeks back about some things.

I’ve been with my bf for around 7 months, and we typically get along together and he’s usually very sensitive and caring but does have moments where he can be weirdly mean. I have no idea why he did to me. I was supposed to go over to his house today and he said “what would you do if I had some cigarettes for us?” At first I was hesitant and even replied “deadass? That’s a mean joke if you don’t” he then keeps going on and on until I say I’d have to wait til tomorrow to smoke (I got my wisdom teeth out 3 days and they say wait 72 hours).

Personally, ever since 'realizing' I had a problem, I've had a tendency to subtly vilify my own drug use. I felt guilty every time I smoked (marijuana.) I viewed it as a problem, something that needed to be fixed. For me, it was the source of a lot of suffering. An endless cycle it seemed.

Perhaps it'd be a positive thing to view my addiction more as something like, a compulsion that manifests complete with an offering of service, that is, an opportunity to learn something. This makes the ""problem"" feel much less heavy, so to speak. It gives the person something tangible to work with.

Five years ago I met a man and we had a whirlwind romance.   He’s always been a gambler. That was his reputation among everyone before I even met him. I was the last to know. Shooting dice, cards, sports bets, going to the casino, you name it. We lived together, he worked hard to get away from everyone he knew who did that stuff, got himself into GA, and gave me all the money.       Fast forward. Now I’m back home with my parents raising our 2 1/2 year-old  and our six month old alone. We lost everything. He emptied out every account, would pretend that he was going to self exclude by having me handle everything, and then get pretty upset or find a way to get around me. He emptied out everything. I work two jobs now to pay for everything for the kids. He doesn’t contribute at all.  Since 2020 began, he has seen his children once. He doesn’t contribute money, and I speak to his mother and sister who tell me that despite him coming home around 6AM to sleep, he wakes up, goes to work (Cash job, paid daily), and that’s his routine. I speak to him. It’s the usual stuff. “I’m so sorry. I hate myself. I’m going to ban myself in the casinos. I’m going to get back into the program. I’m going to give you all the money every night.” He even shares his location with me through iPhone (his suggestion) in a stunt to give me some reassurance (phone turns off every night at 3AM and comes back on when he’s out of money).  We sat down last Monday and had a super long super emotional talk when I told him that it’s not even his sickness it hurts me so much- I’ve been with him and seen him though it for what feels like forever and I understand it’s very deeply rooted. What kills me is that he lies to me and excludes me when he gets the itch. It feels like I’m being stabbed in the back. He loves our kids and he loves me. But when he gets on these streaks, and he’s asking me for money for gas to get to work, and he’s missing the kids growing up... I feel scared for the future.  How long do I keep trying? What happens when he keeps emptying the accounts and I’ve got two mouths to feed? I am posting here for advice.  Do I give up? Is there hope? I still love him so much.

807,addiction,2020/02/18,"Jung’s Shadow Part 2: Opposites and Tarot Jung’s Shadow Part 2:  Opposites and Tarot

&amp;#x200B;

Description: 

The Nutty prof begins by saying this is the follow up to the previous PC on integrating shadow and he adds the concept of “POTE” to his PATAP approach to addiction (as an analogy to help understand cravings at different levels).  He also reminds viewers of the Freudian concepts of Eros and Thanatos (Life and Death instincts) from a previous podcast. 

This leads him to talk about the process of attempting to “reconcile” other “opposites” besides “Eros and Thanatos”, these include forward and back, up and down, light and dark, in and out, and he also discusses other “metaphors” for “movement” like “circles” and “spirals”.  He proceeds to discuss symbols and how he doesn’t take them “literally” and he mentions that he recently had a Tarot card reading.  

He focuses on the three cards he selected during the reading, the first was the “World” card and it seems to deal with links to the community.  The second card was “Enemies” and deals with conflict, he discusses a conflict with a former friend (without going into a lot of details) and how at one time he’d had conflicts with his father but those issues seem resolved but he considers that conflict could also refer to the inner conflicts involved in confronting shadow/reconciling opposites.  He also shares a couple of dreams he had that seem to compliment the Tarot reading.   The most positive card was the third which suggested stresses are temporary (one needs to detach from them).  The nutty prof ends with a reference to the book “Heart of Darkness” (adapted into “Apocalypse Now”) saying his goal is to be the Sheen character who returns from the journey to darkness and not the Brando character who goes mad and he says he’ll keep viewers posted.

Gambling since 21. 

Smoking since 17. 

I took up video gaming to replace the gambling and it's somewhat problematic too. 

But for me, it's about what I've invested right? So, in 10 years, I've lost teeth and health to smoking. But if  quit now, then what's it all been for? Not to mention probably the close to 50k I've spent on cigars. 

With gambling, I've made several hundred thousand, and lost maybe 100k. I'm up, as it were, but I still see the vice. With gambling there was times I'd get nervous shakes not going to the casino. 

But over the years, these vices become part of our identity. And I guess if I leave them behind, what was it all for? I've tried quitting smoking several times and can't ever seem to get it right.

I feel lucid and clear and have even gone and seen old friends &amp; family and they've remarked upon the improvement, it's also great to be able to go somewhere and not have to worry about where the nearest pharmacy is or withdrawal setting in and the persistent diarrhea.

I have to thank this Subreddit because it wasn't all that long ago that I made a post about being close to suicide because of  this, and the users who spoke to me sparked something in me to finally turn my life around (granted it was a few more months of using, but everyone needs to do things at their own speed right?)

I wouldn’t actually consider myself addicted to drugs (other then alcohol), I just see the red flags in my usage. I don’t use frequently (I can’t lie though, that’s due to lack of access). But I do drugs consecutively when I have them, or mix them with other things. 

Therese are the instances that come to mind 

- Once I came across some leftover Focalin from an old prescription. I’d never used my meds recreationally, but instantly jumped to snorting it. Then I did the same thing the next 7 days. Everyday I told myself “I won’t do this again tomorrow I’ll make these last”. A couple days I snorted it in the bathroom during class, another day I snorted it in the bathroom while my partner at the time napped. One day when I tried to go without it I ended up leaving lunch to “grab something from the dorm” and did a line. I was really upset when I ran out 

- I ate benexedrex inhalers 2 days in a row, planned for a third, but flushed the remaining cotton when I woke up with heart palpitations

- once I did xanex two nights in a row, followed by hydros two more nights in a row 

- in September I took hydros every weekend, and it’s all I looked forward to during the week 

- I mixed hydros with alcohol 

- mixed lyrica with alcohol 

Then most recently it’s been my adderall usage. I bought adderall the other day. If was innocent enough, I just wanted to get work done. I told myself that I’d 1: only take 5mg (my old prescribed dosage) 2: take it orally 3: not take it multiple days in a row. 

I broke those rules almost instantly. I took 20mg in 2 days, and snorted most of it. I got really agitated yesterday because I couldnt get as high as I wanted, 5mg Focalin does the job for me, and I was getting increasingly upset that adderall didn’t do the same. All that kept me back from taking more was the fact that I couldn’t hit my friend up for more after just a few days, he’d cut me off for sure. My nasty ass also rubbed my adderall snot on my gums not wanting to waste any. 
I’ll probably use more today. 
I’ve also been considering meth. 
It all just got me thinking. 

I don’t have a problem now but quitting alcohol kinda made me see some overlap in behaviors. I don’t want to quit drugs though. I’m really scared to talk about it. Even talking about it on here is hard. It’s just not something I want to give up. I just needed to put this out there, I guess as practice for the convo I have roped myself into.",573,0.0,0,0.0

818,addiction,2020/02/19,"""Its just weed dude"" Whenever I try to talk about my addiction this is the response I'm greeted with. Everyone from my friends to my therapist have downplayed my addiction because ""weed is not addictive"". They've said weed is a medication -- that what I'm doing is just a way of medicating myself because of my bipolar disorder. I have spent years trying to convince myself that I'm not addicted to weed because its somehow healthy for me but I'm finally ready to put my foot down and stop lying to myself.

Weed has ruined my life over the past couple years. It has been a major financial burden because all of my money that didnt go to my bills went into buying more weed. I would prioritize weed over anything else and when I couldnt afford it I would get desperate and end up buying it by making up excuses to borrow money and mooching off others. When I try to quit I feel this desperate primal hatred and jealousy towards anyone who brings marijuana around me. Every fiber of my being NEEDS it the moment I see, smell or talk/hear about it. I hate myself so much for the malicious thoughts that run through my head when my desire for marijuana outweighs my love for those around me. I hate feeling powerless to the rage caused by the idea of somebody either taking my weed or not sharing their weed with me. 

Yes... Weed is not physically addictive but it is mentally/emotionally and of course it has a lot of medicinal uses. For me, marijuana used to feel like my only escape from my emotions and now I feel just feel numb when I'm high. I keep telling myself that I dont need marijuana and that people enjoy me more when I am sober but this only works when I'm feeling level headed.

826,addiction,2020/02/20,"Society Blows!!! I know that overcoming addiction requires taking full accountability for the choice to become addicted to something, and I do take complete responsibility.  However, I find myself becoming increasingly enraged by a modern society (particularly in the West) that encourages, almost worships, being addicted to things.  Don’t get me wrong, commit a crime under the influence and you go to jail, your mug shot gets uploaded to the web, and people condemn you.  But addiction itself has simply become a way of being.  High functioning addicts are simply accepted.  It isn’t until your life ends up in the gutter that people tell you, “maybe you should get some help.”  I went to university, where everyone partied on Wednesday nights and on the Weekends.  It was just what people did (unless you were serious about a career, that is).  Everyone was also addicted to caffeine.  Borderline sex addiction, under the mask of sex positivity and empowerment, also has become the college way.  Don’t take this as a knock on sexual freedom or me telling anyone how they should manage their sex life.  I have no right to do that, no desire to do that...I won’t do that.  But if you are having multiple one night stands, having sex with a different person more than once a week, or as many times as every other day, you really ought to think about whether that is healthy.  Again, I do not think I have a right to tell anyone what to do.  I simply think that there is a bitter irony in our obsession on staying thin when we spend every minute of every day being hooked on something.  Not only are we hooked on substances (and also making marijuana legal; that is a whole other can of worms), but we are hooked on behaviors too.  Pop music is now addictive (music producers deliberately use “hooks” that provide hits to the reward centers in our brain).  Social media is addictive.  The internet is addictive.

Is there a second of our day where we aren’t getting hits from something?

I don’t think it is possible NOT to get hits.  I think that our brain is wired with a reward center that makes sure we are motivated to eat, procreate, and get things done.  Our reward center is what inspires us to learn new things, to read, to partake in creative endeavors.  Without our reward center we would hardly be human at all.

Indeed, one of the best ways to overcome addictions, is ironically, to hook your reward center to more healthy alternatives, like meditation, exercise, or a creative hobby.

What angers me is that society continues (and will continue to) endorse the most dangerous kinds of addiction, simply to make a buck.  It seems that no one cares about this until it is too late.  And no one pays attention to anyone who calls this out.  We are considered party poopers, or eccentrics.

I am getting clean for myself, my wife, and our newly arrived son.  Not for the world outside.  But I would be lying if I said that I didn’t get angry, or even a little hopeless about our future, in a world that says being addicted is a good thing.",549,1.0,1,0.0018214936247723133

I started drinking very early at an age of 13-14 years and smoked my first joint at 15-16. Between the ages of 16 and 19 my use had extended to mdma, speed, coke, opioids (mostly tramadol), benzos, psychedelics etc.

After not having failed a single grade my whole life, I'm currently doing my third year of high school for the second time. After I had a mental breakdown sometime late spring last year, my brother took me with him to another city to work at a restaurant for a couple of months. I got clean and as I came back I wasn't using anything apart from the casual joint here and there every other week. I thought I was finished.

Last semester I came back to school motivated and excited to kind of prove my self. It went great, but sometime this winter I had my first relapse. I began drinking in the evenings as I have a lot of anxiety towards the nights. As my stepdad found I had been stealing his booze he put a padlock on the cabinet and since then I have used several other drugs. Benzos, weed, tramadol, speed. I can just wake up one day and it's like I'm a different person. I don't care - just wanna get high - fuck it.

So here I am, once again, beginning to fall behind in class, with a beer on my desk. I'm really fucking worried. I feel like I have so much potential, it's all I've heard all my life. I feel like I'm throwing my whole life away.

I can't trust my self. It feels like I've lost all control and I'm starting to lose hope. Most of my friends and family think I'm clean for good. I'm hiding my use. I don't know who to talk to so I guess that's why I'm making this post (maybe it's just cause I'm drunk and emotional).

I have never posted on reddit before, so I made an account just to share this thinking maybe it would help someone else the way it did for me. Sorry for any grammer, spelling, or structuring errors as I was a little emotional writing this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Addiction,

I don’t remember the first time we met. I know it was a long time ago, and over time we became friends. We became the best of friends. We got closer and closer to the point that I didn’t really think I needed anyone else. When I was down you picked me up. When I was sad you made me happy. When I was alone you comforted me. I really didn’t think I needed anyone else except for you.

The pain of hiding my secrets from being molested and coping with the fact that I never knew my dad you showed me how to make myself feel better with overeating food and sweet treats when I was far to young to deal with them. When I was struggling to make friends and being bullied every day in grade school for my weight and being different you showed me how to stave off the suffering and isolation by watching porn compulsively and hiding who I was and how I felt from other people. When I was struggling to fit in with people in high school you told me how to use Adderall and lying to make people think I was someone I wasn’t, and you told me this was okay. That it was normal. 

Over the years I started to believe you. I believed you man. I trusted you. You were supposed to protect me and take care of me. No one else did. No one else did. The truth is that you were the one that was sad and alone, and you didn’t want anyone else to have me like a controlling and possessive stalker. You made me believe that no one else would care. That no one else wanted to listen. I believed I was a weak loser who was dumb and needed you to survive. For while there I honestly believed you when you made me think that you were the only one who would ever be there for me. You gaslighted me and made me believe that all this was normal behavior, and that I was not strong enough to live life on my own terms and get what I want.

You made me think it was normal to avoid your family. Normal to live with shame. Normal to drink and do drugs every day. Normal to watch progressively more and more taboo porn and wake up with a twisted sexuality every day. Normal to avoid my girlfriend or lie to her. Normal for my bad behaviors and emotional burdens to become hers as well. I know now that it’s not, and that you just wanted me for yourself. Normal to avoid my son because I wanted to hang out with you instead. Normal to think that giving into weakness was okay instead of becoming stronger. None of that shit is normal, and you led me to believe with a million reasons and excuses that it was just who I was.

I have decided we can’t be friends anymore. You just aren’t good for my life. My family, my health mentally, sexually, and physically is more important than the temporary relief and high we find together. I’m sorry, it’s not easy for me to write this letter, but it must be done. I need to go on to make new friends and relationships. I need to be able to show my family and girlfriend that I love them in a healthy way. I can’t do that with you hanging around anymore. You need to go. I appreciate the life lessons you taught me, but now it’s time to grow. 

Don’t try to come back or sneak back in because I know your tricks now. I know I can’t trust you. I know now that you never really were my friend but my user and manipulator. 

Sincerely, 

Your old friend.",717,0.0,0,0.0
832,addiction,2020/02/20,"Anyone experience withdrawals from stopping heavy daily weed use? I had a surprise when I tried to stop everything for a week. Day 3 I was lethargic, had trouble focusing and blurry vision, head “chills” going down into my spine, even more shaky than usual with muscle twitches, and I was hotter than usual, tingling/numbness on finger tips and lips at one point. Then day 4 was the opposite, had more than enough energy even without caffeine, but crazy anxiety and jitters that got worse throughout the day until eventually it turned to a steady panic attack for hours until me and my girlfriend started getting into an argument and I said fuck it. 

Growing up it was always said pot doesn’t give you withdrawals, so I’m skeptical. Maybe its somehow in my head and you guys telling me that will help next time. But at one point it was close to when I came off benzos suddenly, but  without the head zaps. 

I have smoked/vaped heavily without fully missing a day for at least 2 years. Whenever I’m not working basically. I relied on it with my depression, to unwind after a stressful day, and to eat since at one point I stopped eating and I haven’t gotten any hunger back even though I’m in a better place. It’s going to be hard to call it quits for a bit and especially since nothing is forcing me to do it. But I want to at least stop everything else and cut this down to a reasonable amount.

I told her we can not go through courts if she takes a drug test and proves to me that the drug dealer is no longer in the picture but of course that makes me a controlling piece of sh*t.

Last year I had to move back home with my parents as I was identified for something I did half a decade ago and was ordered by a judge to pay a huge compensation for it. Most of my pay checks the last year have gone towards that and it still haven't made any visible change to the amount I owe. 

I still work minimum wage jobs and my coworkers are just as fucked as me. The only difference is they never tried to change their way and keeps inviting me to work the kind of overtime that's requiring ski masks. I have been turning them down so far as my record is so close to getting wiped clean but fuck me, I'm done trying to be better. I'm ready to get back into the shit.

Last weekend the biggest reason for my change in lifestyle broke it off with me. Now that I have lost her, wtf else do I have to lose? fuck my record, fuck my future, I'm already fucked. I'm fucking tired of being broke. I miss being able to travel every month or being able to go clubbing with friends. I fucking miss being able to grocery shop without looking at the prices.  I miss my old, happy go lucky self. I miss being able to stand on a balcony without having thoughts of jumping. I miss loving life so much I don't need a six pack of beer and 2 grams of hash in the evening just to being able to sleep. In fact, I haven't been able to sleep without a buzz since I was 14. I honestly don't think I have had a real sober day since I begun. I have either been drunk, high or on pills everyday with no exception.  

I don't know precisely what my future will bring. I just know that my current situation won't stay the same. Either I die, get locked up or relocates to a tropical island with a bag of cash.

851,addiction,2020/02/22,"HELP! 10 yrs on Clonazepam and need to withdraw. Need advice! Hi Everyone...I’m in my late 50’s and have been on many types of meds over the yrs, but have never run into a monster like Clonazepam withdrawal. It was initially prescribed for sleep and anxiety along with the other daily pills I take, primarily Effexor. The dosage was increased due to tolerance until I am now on 4 mg of Clonazepam per day. Not only is the Clonazepam not helping me sleep, it seems that it may be affecting my balance and coordination, causing me to trip and fall. I fidget constantly and can’t keep my legs still. I believe it is also causing me to feel like I’m living in a fog. I forget people’s names, events and places I’ve been to, and have lost my sense of direction. I tried a Dr. supervised withdrawal 2 yrs ago; within 48 hrs, my muscles started jerking, I was sweating, and I felt suicidal. I was quickly put back on the full 4 mg. But I need to get off of it. I am also going through breast cancer treatment (no medications, just surgery at this point) and will need medications in the near future. I am so worried about the Clonazepam withdrawal that I am wondering if I should just stay on it. If anyone has any advice on tapering very slowly, I’d so appreciate it.

852,addiction,2020/02/22,"The 12 Steps (advice on Step 3) FYI the ***italics stuff*** I added when I reread my post for spelling errors, in trying to explain why I didn't understand how I could use someone elses joy as my higher power I may have begun to understand how to use someone elses joy as my higher power... but I'm not sure. Am I doing this right?

Not sure if anyone is still here...

Firstly, I'm struggling with step 3, the higher power thing. I used to be a christian, and whilst I still have some beliefs around there being a ""God"" and prayer helping my mind if doing nothing else, I don't think I feel comfortable using something I don't KNOW that I believe in as my higher power. Russel Brand talks about his being ""energy"" and ""nature"" and so on. That's too intangible for me. I have thought of trying to use my wife's love for me, but she's on the verge of leaving me so there is a fear that rug will be pulled from under me. As I was sat playing with my daughter this morning she started giggling at me and I thought ""Ah HA! That's my higher power, my daughters joy for me""... but what does that mean? ***I turn over my will and my life to my daughters joy... [in fact... now I've written that down... it kind of makes sense... Am I on the right track here]***

I think of myself as a fairly intelligent, well educated person but I just cannot get what this higher power should feel like to me. I've read it can be a football team or a cartoon character or someone you look up to... but that all seems a bit farcical. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

853,addiction,2020/02/22,"Quitting cocaine for good! I'm done advice pls! First time posting here, any really advice from anyone who can relate would be appreciated.

I've used coke on and off for the last 10 years, I'm in my 30s now. When I first tried it I was out at a club with friends and I just really loved how confident it made me feel but after my first comedown from hell I swore I'd never do it again.. but then i found that nights out with just alcohol always felt like something was missing so i began using it only on nights out but occasionally because the comedowns always hit me really hard. I even went a couple years without using because I just didnt want to do it. 

So fast forward to now I recently moved house and dont know many people where I live and out of boredom and loneliness I began using again. What started out as the odd weekend turned into every week using at least 3-4 times a week. I was going through an 8 ball a week doing a gram and half a night and it started getting out of control. It dawned on me that I have a problem and when I tried not to use for a week I found myself dreaming about using and daydreaming about using all day every day! It drove me crazy. So I picked up again and went out by myself to an open mic night, I got drunk and high because i wasnt confident enough to sing sober. Anyway after i got home i had the worst comedown I've had in ages and genuinely felt like i was in the verge of a heart attack. This scared me so I threw the rest of what was left away and literally stayed awake all night afraid to sleep incase I didnt wake up. So I quit smoking, drinking everything cold turkey because I desperately want to stop for good but today (a week on) I felt so bored I decided to pick up a half a gram, reasoning that as long as I didnt do too much I would be ok. So i paced myself and didnt drink too much like I usually do when out of nowhere this sharp chest pain comes over me and everytime I breathed I tensed up. Again I was terrified thinking I was on the verge of a heart attack! I immediately stopped and drank a load of water. Intested my heart rate and it was 97 bpm so I just decided to throw the rest in the toilet and kept drinking water. I feel much better now but I really need advice on how to quit for good! Rehab isnt an option and I've tried cocaine anon which didnt help because I met someone who hooked me up with a dealer! I've deleted his number now and I know I'm so ready to quit for good, the high just isnt worth playing rush and roulette with my life over. I really want to quit for good and I dont want to be tempted again in future because it's easy to forget how awful you felt when your craving again. Has anyone successfully quit coke if so how did you do it? Any tips advice would be much appreciated! Thanks guys!",579,0.0,0,0.0

857,addiction,2020/02/22,"We aren’t trash! Bumps on the road to recovery I just wanted to share a little of my story with somebody. Something I need to say. I’m a recovering addict. I have been sober now over 2 years. Three years ago I decided I’d  had enough. I’d been addicted to opiates since my teen years, (the byproduct of constant migraines and a script happy Dr)I ended up physically addicted at 15. That’s how it started anyway. 

Now a lot happened in those years of using but that’s story. So after around 20years of using, I hit my breaking point and decided to get help. I spent almost a year in treatment but had to be discharged early due to medical reasons. About 3 months after I got out my mother passed away after a long battle with a blood clotting disorder. Yep! You guessed it! I relapsed. After I lost another 8 months to addiction, I managed to pull myself together so I could keep my promise to my Mama and started clawing my way out again.

 I enrolled in a methadone clinic and buckled down to get my life straight. I got a steady job, a car and I started seeing a guy I had known for years. It was an amazing time. I felt like I was finally on the way to having a normal happy life and that this was what life was supposed to be like all along! For the first time in my life I was excited about my future. 

My boyfriend  was wanting to move to Florida before we even got together and he invited me to come as well. I can’t tell you how stoked I was! We lived in Alaska at the time and I have pretty much lived in cold states all my life. I always wanted to move where it had warm weather and sunny beaches, also I was head over heels in love with him so why the hell not? (I should mention that he has a teen son, it is relevant later in the story). Anyway I had multiple conversations with him before the move,  because of my addiction issues I was still baffled that anyone would want a life with me. I asked if he was sure he wanted me to come, to which he always said that he did. 

After months of hard work and packing we finally make the move. As soon as we got to Florida though, his attitude and demeanor started changing.....(y’all can prob guess where this is headed). I got a job about a week after we arrived as a housekeeper at a local hotel. I knew something was up but he kept saying everything was fine so I tried to convince myself of that. 

Then one day about a week and a half in to my new job, he was driving me to work and informed me that he didn’t love me and just wanted it to be him and his son. I was crushed! I had just moved almost 5000 miles and spent every last dime I had to start a life with this guy and 3 weeks in, he is throwing me away?! I didn’t know anyone in Florida and had nowhere to go. I was a pitiful wreck for weeks. I decided I wasn’t going to let this destroy me and I ended up finding and renting a room, then buckled down to try to make a life for myself in Florida. 

I worked really hard at the hotel and made it to the front desk. Learning the ropes of every department from Front desk to maintenance, I threw myself in to my job. My manager (we will call him D) was talking a lot about my future in the company, him wanting to train me up to be in management one day ect.... until one day I accidentally knocked over a sharps container. It was faulty so all the needles spilled out on the floor. 
I was trying to be extremely careful while picking them up but still managed to stick myself. 

That led to a workman’s comp claim and a Dr visit. Well D decided to require a UA. (Remember I said I was going to a methadone clinic)? Now I knew D had a very low opinion of addicts. He made derogatory comments all the time about guests that were suspected of using or just looked like they would. Due to this I was terrified of him finding out I was a recovering addict and did everything in my power to keep it secret but now I had to give a UA.  I. Was. Terrified! Thought for sure going to be fired. I figured the best thing to do would be to get ahead of it. I thought if I told him before the results came back that it would be better. So I told him hoping to salvage my job. He didn’t react much but said something along the lines of we will pretend you never told me this which relieved me somewhat. I still had my job! It was all going to be ok! 

Nope. Everything changed. All of a sudden I couldn’t do anything right. I got really sick and had to call in and he made out like I called in all the time. It was only the second time in a year! He wrote me up for things but not other employees. If I made a mistake he’d harp on it for days. He cut my hours so I was having a really hard time making ends meet. There was no more talk about me moving up in the company or future management positions. 

About when things were starting to go sour  one of our regulars at the hotel (we will call him EW) had been asking me if I’d work with his 24 yo autistic son up in Indiana. I had a great rapport with his son who is a wonderful young man whenever they came to the hotel. So He wanted to hire me as a live in caregiver. I wanted to stay in Florida where it’s warm so I always kind of laughed it off but he was persistent so I started talking to him on the phone to get to know him and the situation with his son better. After a couple of months of talking. I decided to go up there for a week to visit and check it out. EW told me to just quit my job and move to Indiana. If I decided I didn’t like it, no hard feelings and he’d pay me $5000 to hold me till I was able to find another job.I wasn’t wanting to do that so I decided to go up for a week to visit and see how things went. 

Well I WASNT intending to quit my job. A week before I’m supposed to go to Indiana, I show up to work and D calls me in his office. He informs me that he is writing me up AGAIN for something that EVERY SINGLE Front Desk Associate there does frequently but only I was getting written up. I couldn’t take it anymore and I quit. Thinking in the back of my head that I had a job in Indiana or at least the $5000 for cushion that he promised since I had now quit my job. Looking back I wish I hadn’t been such a hot head and quit but we will just chalk that up to the MANY mistakes I have made. 

When I get to Indiana everything is ok the first day or so. Then one morning I wake up to him in my bed kissing on me. I flipped out. He apologized and said he understood when I laid out exactly what I was and WASNT there for. If I had had enough money at the time, I would have bought a ticket home the next day but as it was I was stuck there until my return trip.  He didn’t listen. The entire week he tried to get me to sleep with him even to the point of begging. Telling me he only has 3 months to live and that he’ll marry me and leave everything to me and his son, all I have to do is sleep with him. I honestly thought about it. I’d never have to worry about money again but I’d never be able to live with myself after. The shame I felt from just considering it was enough. I felt hunted the entire week. 

It was coming time for me to leave and he wanted me to go to Florida pack my stuff and come back. I didn’t argue about it, I just let him think that. I sacrificed half of the clothes I brought cause I was just trying to get through my time there safely and figured it was safer if he thought I was coming back. 

When I finally got back to Florida and I informed him that I wasn’t coming back because of his behavior, he refused to pay the money he promised. He told me that I was just a piece of shit junkie and that I threw away the first half of my life and trash should stay thrown away. He said I should have just given it to him because nobody else will ever want me.  He texted my sister and told her I stole money from him to buy drugs and crap like that. 

So now I’m unemployed and back to square one but throughout ALL of this I have not relapsed. I have actually been on a taper these last 2 years and I’m almost off. I started out at 90mg and I have tapered down to 20mg. I have made many mistakes in the last 2 years but I’ve kept my promise to myself and my Mama. I’m struggling. I don’t know how I’m going to eat or pay my bills but I know im not im not trash. Even though people treat me and fellow addicts that way. I won’t let them destroy me and I won’t let these people make me feel like I belong in the hole I just scraped &amp; clawed my way out of. Yes. I am a recovering addict. That does not make my life any less important, meaningful, impactful or worth less than anyone else’s. I’m still fighting! It’s been tough and it’s probably going to get tougher but I know I can stay sober through it. I never thought I’d be able to say that. I hope one day that all those suffering with addiction can say it.",1838,0.0,0,0.0

But I also knew you couldn’t snort, booty bump, smoke, etc. it because I thought it has to go through your liver to convert to an amphetamine. So I got on the internet, as one does, to figure out if there was a way to extract the amphetamine without taking it so I could smoke it. Well, there was, and it was pretty simple too. Just soak the Vyvanse in alcohol and then let it dry for a long ass time (no idea if this actually works. Would not recommend trying. You’ll see why). The thing was I didn’t have any alcohol. I was only 18 so I couldn’t buy liquor. And yes, I could have gone to a pharmacy and picked up some rubbing alcohol, but I was 18 and I wanted to smoke RIGHT NOW. So what is one to do? Well soak the Vyvanse in poppers (amyl nitrate) of course. That makes sense. It’s the same thing as alcohol right..? 

Spoiler, it isn’t. I soaked 5 pills worth of the powder in the poppers and waited about maybe 30 minutes or so. It was dry enough...I thought. So I put the still wet powder in my bong and lit that shit up. Well, it exploded. I mean sparks flying everywhere. Who could have known??? I wanted to get high so badly I was still trying to hit it as the sparks flew. 

So after about 4 or 5 more attempts to smoke it, I gave up. I got a moderate amount of Vyvanse smoke in my lungs...and some combusted poppers. I would love to say it was the best high of my life, but, sadly, I felt nothing at all. Thankfully I didn’t cause any damage to myself or the apartment, but you damn sure I was pissed I wasted 5 Vyvanse.

I look back at my 18-year-old self and just hang my head in shame. That wasn’t even the stupidest shit I did. But I had a lot of fun. So, worth it right?",400,0.0,0,0.0

862,addiction,2020/02/22,"I need to help my sister but I don’t know how Last summer my family and I slowly came to the realization that my younger sister (30) was probably using crystal meth. It started when she asked our father to help her inspect her electrical outlets and light fixtures for hidden cameras and fiber optic cables. He didn’t know has to deal with the situation and ended up playing along with the inspection. Then a few weeks later our mother was visiting her (our parents have been split since she was born and they don’t speak so she didn’t know about the outlet ordeal). M noticed S was looking around her house almost desperately while M and her boyfriend were sitting on the couch with my niece (3). M’s boyfriend noticed he had sit on something and then realized it was a bag with what he told me later looked like icy crystals. M inexplicably gave the bag to S and asked her about it. S deflected and nothing else was said about it. When I eventually get these two stories from my parents I started working to bring my parents together to plan an intervention. This took too long and S’s situation worsened. Before we could do the intervention S was found by police on the side of the road after she had pulled over on some out of the way county road. She had her daughter in her car seat and was passed out in the driver seat. The deputy said that it was clear they had been sitting there a while and that it was around 5 am when he showed up. The result was felony child endangerment, resisting arrest and some other charges I don’t fully recall. Human services gets involved and the baby is taken and put into the car of my father and step mother. That happened in July and my sister still has not faced those charges in court and my dad still has temporary custody, so at least the child is safe. 

Since then we have all tried to talk to S about rehab and getting help but she has refused and denied everything since day one. According to her she has never been on drugs and the whole thing is a big conspiracy against her. Any time I talk to her on the phone she will act like everything is completely normal in her life until I bring up these issues and she will start to accuse me of being an imposter pretending to be her brother. The entire situation is hard to confront. To top it off she divorced her husband one month after the arrest and is now homeless. Several family members including cousins have tried taking her in and one even got her a job at the nursing home she works at. But she failed the pee test. Of course that too was a conspiracy and the administer of the test tampered with it. She has burned many bridges and is sitting in county jail right now for contempt of court in a completely different charge unrelated to the original arrest. She has been in there a week now because this time the bail bondsman won’t even get out because she skipped on her last bond. I feel horrible making her sit in jail because I know that county jail is a horrible place to have to sober up and that there are no programs in place to help these inmates beyond the bare minimum. The problem is if I get her out of jail I know she still won’t go to rehab. Right now the plan is to let her stay in jail for a month or so before any of us go visit. Then we will offer to get her out if she will sign herself into treatment. I don’t know if this is the right thing or not, but it’s the only thing I can think to do at this point.

At least that's what I tell myself, but every other alternative addiction group gives me a bad vibe too. Maybe out of fear.

I'm sorry if this is a long post but as a 27 year old male I have found reddit to be a sanctuary for me since I was 19. Reddit was that person whom I adored but could never muster up the courage to approach. I lurked, I even flirted with the idea of posting on some sports subreddits. But those were the good days in my relationship with reddit. Today as someone who has never reached out for help I am truly desperate. My heart is broken, my soul is tortured and my future is in jeopardy. Dear reddit community, please help me. I come from an impoverished family who risked it all to make it to this country which makes this even more painful for me. If I was an addict in the nation by parents were born in, I'd be dead. However, as a first generation college student in my family I made it from the depths of poverty to graduating from UC Berkeley in Political Science. I'm no better or worse but I sacrificed everything, this country gave me an opportunity to prove my will and my desire through education. I was given a battlefield where all other factors were meaningless, merit was key. 

Today, as I lay in bed 13 days sober and completely dead inside and out, the pain of everything I built being destroyed before my very eyes is otherworldly. In the span of 2 years I went from having foot surgery to being a full blown addict in Los Angeles with nothing left. I first took an opiate when I returned home from college and although I no longer had access to them after my post surgery cycle, I was able to obtain adderall and the rest feels like a flash. When I stopped 13 days ago I had been taking adderall for almost 2 years intermittently and looking for anything I could get my hands on to sleep. This can't be real, all I ever wanted was to teach History and give back to the country that saved my life. To the next generation of youth that without the opportunity I was given, would be relegated to the doldrums of history. Believe it or not, I loved education so much that I'm mourning that loss more than the damage I've inflicted on my family, on my body an on my soul. My thoughts are scattered, my pain is deserved but I just want help. I didn't sleep for 6 days when i stopped, the stress on my family caused my 65 year old mother to get into an accident. I had never seen my father cry before. I saw that too. I don't know if I deserve life any longer for what I've done but if reddit can be the one thing I gain instead of lose from this nightmare, I'd be forever grateful.

886,addiction,2020/02/24,"Can't get over drinking and smoking They say ""old habits die hard"" and I guess that's true!

Hi there! I am 27 y.o. male struggling to give up smoking and drinking and generally destructing myself. I need someone to tell me that this is doable because I am tired of trying and failing.

I can't make a shortcut of my situation so you'll have to stick with me here. I've been smoking and drinking for almost 8 years straight no attempts to give up at all. I never gave it any thought, never thought why I am doing this to myself. I guess I was just young and stupid. I had quite a rough childhood...well it was good, not complaining here, but I had a few traumatic incidents and problems with parent support - grown up without father (died when I was 12, seen him a couple of times before he passed away) and my mother never cared about my teen issues. So I grew up learning to deal with my problems on my own, friends were never there to truly understand and not just ""listen"". Fifteen years old me was having quintessential issues - all I thought about at the time was what's my purpose of living and why on Earth I was born in such a shitty place to live (living in a shithole in some CIS country btw).

I guess all that stuff eventually determined my behavior in some way. I started having this tendency of self-destruction. As years passed I kept on smoking and drinking. Been in a deep depression couple of times, but made it through eventually. Traveled around the world for some time and after coming back home I began working as an ESL teacher (had to make a living somehow) then I found that I am doing pretty well at teaching and it became my profession. My job was incompatible with smoking so I quit. I still don't really understand how I gave it up so easily. I quitted cold turkey, but the other self-destructive habits remained. For some time I was really happy with myself - life took a new turn and it seemed to be brighter than it ever was. But all good things must come to an end, right!?

After three years of not smoking I started all over. Came back from 0 to 15 cigarettes a day. It was awful, I hated every single cigarette I smoked, but this time I couldn't quit. So last half a year I was trying to give up smoking because it affects my mind. I can't think clearly when I smoke, my decision making became worse and critical thinking in general has blunted. I've been failing to quit over and over again. Every time I returned to smoking I analyzed what I did wrong to start it again and couldn't see the reason behind it. Then I've made some research into why I am doing what I am doing and found out that this self-destructive behavior comes from my adolescence - I tend to smoke and drink whenever I feel bad or stressed and I perceive it as a support of some kind, which makes sense since nobody ever was there to support me when I needed it.

Now I work on myself. I've put a lot of effort to quit smoking. I go to the gym and work my ass off, also I work on my mindset and always try to keep myself in a good state, but however long I hold on to good things in my life there's always a moment when I break - something happens and I start feeling this urge to smoke or drink. It feels like some part of me just can't stand me being a ""good guy"". So I am wondering is it even possible to overcome this dark part of my nature that always wants me to destroy myself and hate life?! I look at it as a battle and I always lose it. Neither cigarettes nor alcohol give no pleasure or consolation any more, but still can't get rid of that shit.

TL;DR - struggling to overcome bad habits, fail to keep self-improvement consistent.

Healthcare Professional addicted to stimulants but afraid of being reported after seeking help I’m a 26 year old Registered Nurse in NYC and I’ve been abusing adderall for about 8 years. I started taking it in college about once or twice a week solely to study for exams. For about 4 years I never exceeded 30mg a day. Once I graduated, passed my boards, and got a job, I was convinced I would stop. Yet I would randomly find myself craving it to get that euphoric feeling or to motivate me to do chores, crochet, or do the most random activities. 

I am now up to about 80mg a day about 3-4 times a week. On rare occurrences I’ve taken up to 120mg within a 24hr period. I’ve been wanting to stop for about 2 years but it’s been SO difficult. 

I am now developing physical symptoms such as random episodes of chest tightness, headaches, insomnia, nausea, and more. When I’ve gone a few days without it, I get extremely depressed and sometimes experience anxiety attacks. I barely leave my house or visit my family and friends anymore. I’ve lost a lot of weight. This drug is completely taking over my life.

It’s reaching a point where I’m considering seeking help from a medical professional. My biggest fear is that I could be reported by an MD for abusing drugs and potentially lose my job. I’ve tried to do research on laws against this, but google has been giving me so many mixed responses. 

So basically my questions are:

- Are MDs, therapists, or psychiatrists legally required to report me to my job for using drugs even if I’m looking for help?
- What are some tips to ease the depression / anxiety associated with the withdrawals?
- Should I see a therapist or a psychiatrist? 
- Is it safe to stop cold-turkey or is micro-dosing a necessity?

Now, every waking moment all I can do is remember who I once was.. I hate who I have become. It feels like overnight I've turned into a monster. My bad decisions are written all over my face and I feel like I'm living in another person's life. I have dreams about my past and remember what it was like to be loved, and thought about and cared for by friends and family. I simply can't accept this new life I've made for myself. It's like the second I got off of the adderall, reality hit me. And it wasn't pretty. All I want to do is start taking it again. There's no point in staying sober if the damage is already done, right?. I turned to religion, but it dosent seem to be helping. I don't feel worthy of being a Christian because of how disgusting and damaged I am now.

I also suffer from DID (dissociative identity disorder) and sometimes I don’t remember doing these things or thinking these things because of separate alters formed by trauma. But anyways, I’ve been dog-sitting at my moms house for the week and I was looking for scissors in this junk drawer and found pain pills that were my sisters (23F as well) from the summer when she had her wisdom teeth out. I took them out of the drawer and hid them in my mom’s closet where my suitcase was because I got triggered seeing them in the open in the drawer. It wasn’t like I was going to use them, but it was just the possibility of it being an open option, but I really just wanted them gone and out of the house since idk why they’re there.

911,addiction,2020/02/25,"Cravings after quitting I've been battling Xanax^1 addiction for a good while now. It started as prescribed medication for legit mental health issues and it turned into recreational *""Imma fuck myself up""* hobby of sorts. My favourite part of the day, the one thing I looked forward to, was that time when I will be able to turn off life and take my pills. 

I use (and have in the past) other prescription drugs as medication for issues that I still have but I never abused anything except Xanax.

For me personally physical dependency is easier to conquer when compared to psychological addiction. I was dependant on many drugs (meds) but I always knew I need to suck it up, stick with not taking more and it will be ok. 

When it comes to Xanax I miss being able to ""escape"" reality. It doesn't necessarily make me numb, it numbs part of me that are hurting and I feel like a normal person.

I had periods of using it as a medication, periods of serious abuse, periods of no use at all and, worst of them all - periods when I would stop using only to lower my tolerance so that in the future I can use it again and get that same feeling without needing to further up my dose.

Through all of this I was functional member of society. I limited my use to night time or weekends when I knew I don't need to *""participate in life""* and can just lose myself in haze of feeling like *""life makes sense, I'm not worthless, I'm going to achieve so much""*, while I did zero productive things and went to sleep at 4pm.

I've decided I don't want to lead that life anymore. As good as it does make me feel, I don't want artificial happiness being only form of good feeling I have. 

I've been lowering my dose for quite a while. On Monday I finally didn't take even smallest part of the pill. It's been two days and ""high"" of *""wow I actually did it""* is wearing off. Thoughts about taking it just one more time are creeping in. We all know it's never just one more time. 

Physical dependency is gone, I don't have any withdrawal symptoms. I'm still very much mentally addicted. 

Since going through withdrawals is a motherfucker when you actually don't want to quit, I'm proud of managing to do that. 

People around me aren't aware of how serious this issue is because even when I'd take it in front of someone it didn't make me anything else but more cheerful and talkative (because I always knew my limit and had excuses if it turns ugly). Those aren't stereotypical addiction signs. They aren't negative behaviour and if it's not negative how can it be a problem? Yeah... 

I fucking beat physical dependency. I can finally feel other things beside being irritated at everything and anything. I can finally stop looking at the clock to see is it time to take my next dose that is keeping me from being that frustrated mess in front of others. 

But I miss it so fucking much. 

I'd like to escape from reality I live in now. And I can't even have a drink because other meds I take aren't something you want to mix with alcohol. 

I don't see it as a success anymore and I know I need that feeling in order to not relapse. That would send me down a spiral of self hatred and I would need to use more to not feel like that. Fucking never ending cyclic. 

I want to feel proud when I get the urge and not act on it. 

I don't know am I entitled to that feeling.

I was about to start this paragraph with saying that I’m proud that I can function throughout my life, but that’s not the case just another lie. Whenever I get on cocaine I become a liar, not myself. I never lie when sober, without exception, but become someone entirely different. That’s the reason why I want to get off. I love the feeling, I feel ok health wise, but I hate who I become. As I’m sober I love myself and I strive to be that way but I can’t figure my way around alcohol which seems to be at the core of my problems because 99% of the time I don’t want coke unless I have a few drinks. Any help would be appreciated. Love y’all!",215,0.0,0,0.0

Since I moved in I've suspected that shes using, but I dont have any experience with or being around people that use hard drugs. Recently, we ""found out"" that she is most likely using. If you'd like more details I will tell you but yeah she is definitely smoking something that isnt just weed.

I've been living with her for almost 6 months now, and not once have I seen her cook for her son nor feed him any fruits/veggies. Fast food for every meal as far as I've seen. I dont even want to get into her parenting style. Just..constant yelling. I thought she was just a crappy mom, but now it seems theres a reason.

Normally, I wouldnt care what a grown woman does in her free time. But when its directly affecting her child..I cant just sit back and let her smoke her and her sons life away. Today I brought up to my fiance that we should tell her mother, who also lives with us. He immediately started defending her. We got into a big argument which left me feeling like an outsider to the family. He doesnt want me to say anything to anyone and I'm not sure what to do. 

She has a long history of drug use which my fiance is obviously more knowledgeable about, and he says it's best to just stay out of it. But I disagree. I feel hes not taking this as seriously as it should be because hes been around it for so long. She is on parole for drug use and her sons father JUST got incarcerated for drug possession. This poor kid needs his mom right now more than ever, and he definitely doesnt need her like this.

922,addiction,2020/02/26,"Painkiller Addiction (please help me) Hello, I’m 20 years old and I’m starting to become addicted to painkillers. For some context I grew up in a drug household and was surrounded by it all the time. When I was younger I thought needles, pills and pot was a normal thing for my mother to consume, like medicine. Eventually in 2011 my 4 other siblings plus myself were removed from my mothers home and put into foster care. I was 11 at the time and was coping with separation anxiety/abandonment. Long story short my mom never came back for us and we were all either put into different foster homes or went with the other half of our families. For me I got to be with my grandparents. I struggled with lying, being sneaky and lack of empathy. My grandfather was my moms dad and I had always been told to not act or do certain things bc it was something she would do. As I got older and closer to graduating high school I started drinking, then pot and sneaking boys into my house. Eventually my grandparents found out bc we had cameras and they kicked me out. There’s more to that story but I left in 2017 and never came back. 
Since then I moved and met more people. Got a job and live with my aunt. It’s alright over here but recently I’ve been fighting a slight painkiller addiction. Slight might seem like I’m trying to make it sound less worse but it’s starting to get really bad. 
It started when I got into a car accident with my friend and her boyfriend. It wasn’t a serious crash but it really messed up my back. I never went to the hospital and so I just bought drugstore meds and went on. I hate the hospital anyway so I always try to avoid it. Then a few months later I started smoking pot again to help with my back and other things. Once I started I didn’t need them anymore. But one day at work I had an accident in which I slipped and fell. I had a slight concussion but it wasn’t too serious. I ended up getting workers comp. and got looked at. That’s when they prescribed me painkillers. I wasn’t opposed it was like exciting for me. So I got them and took them non stop. 
Now, I’m still here working and I’m in pain. But my pain isn’t my back it’s now my mental. I’ve been going through relationship issues and struggling with my self image. Now I’m mixing just painkillers, sleeping pills and pot almost everyday. I’m stirring inside my head and it’s like I feel so happy and invincible. The funny thing is this is how my mom started doing drugs. I always told myself growing up that I would never be like her. But here I am 8 years later becoming just like her. I need advice and help because my family had shunned me so it’s not like I have much family support since I’m basically repeating my mothers mistakes. I don’t want to lose myself.

925,addiction,2020/02/26,"A message to newly addicted folks, read this if you’d like to skip a few years of being in and out of hell and possibly multiple rehabs There is a chance we all have as addicts, to drop it and be clean without the dependency monster to come and make us feel like shit. I myself was not in a place where I could stop so I kept going even though I had multiple chances to take the easy road. There is an opportunity or multiple opportunities that every one of us gets in which we can drop the substance that we are addicted and dependent two and leave it right there with minimum withdrawal’s as though an angel Grace’s you and gives you a chance but leaves you solely responsible for your future of addiction.  

I have been through years of addiction and dependency, over eight years at this point now. Early on in my heroin an opiate addiction when it had just started to get bad I had some times where I had tried to quit and it was very difficult because I felt the withdrawals. But also in that area of time I found hope and I found the want to stop for multiple reasons. At this point I gave it up but there was something different about this time, I gave up heroin I begged for no withdrawals and somehow I had very little. Some minor chills but nothing to the extremes of hell and addiction. I remember this time in this day like it was yesterday. I think God for not having to go through what I went through the week or so before and promised myself and The universe that I would never do it again. I took this opportunity and I threw it right into the trash and here I am over eight years later.

Everyone has a chance to get the monster off your back early on with much more ease, the contradicting part is that it’s also quite difficult at this point because you have just gotten started and you don’t see it being that bad because you aren’t intelligent and seasoned in the addiction world yet, you haven’t learned just how awful of a road you’re going down. 

As all seasoned users and addicts who have gone through withdrawal and dependency know, once you get going it becomes worse and worse. As you go farther down the road of your addiction and dependency even if you stop for a couple months and feel better, if you start again it will be that much worse. The road gets harder no matter what but you will be given a chance to break free early on without much suffering from withdrawal if any at all. 



I speak to everyone who gets this chance. Anyone who finds themselves away from their drugs and addiction for a day and thinks that they can make it without using, just stop then and there and save yourself from years of hell and misery. If you pick it up again after you’ve been given your chance and you’ve already experienced the hell of withdrawal then mark my words and understand that you very well may never get another chance without having to go through a total shit storm.",560,0.0,0,0.0

Recently I started working as a researcher for a series of documentaries about addiction for the Dutch public broadcasting (NPO3). That's why I'm looking for people who are addicted, or who recently stopped using.

We intend to follow a few people for several months, so we can (hopefully) give viewers a deeper understanding of what addiction actually means. Why do you choose to use, again and again, even when you don't intend to? And why is it so hard to stay sober?

In the end the viewer (hopefully) gets a personal insight in the lives of several people, and their relentless drive to numb themselves. The documentaries should present an unprejudiced representation of people who are addicted. We want to show that addicts are also plain people, although their lives sometimes maybe seems to be different.With these documentaries we hope to nuance the general knowledge about addiction, and to fight stigmatization.

The coming two months we are researching. We will try to speak with as many people as we can, to get a better idea of what is happening right now. So right now I'm just curious about your stories. The first contacts will stay private.

So first, drugs i take : 
-High dose caffeine (1000mg/day)
-High dose nicotine
-High dose phenibut since 1 month (5gpd)
-Medium dose Kratom (20gpd)
-Low dose benzo (6 mg valium)
-Risperidone (4mg)


Now why i'm stuck, ilness and where i live.

At the moment, i'm in a AirBnB. I have 2 weeks to find an appartment where i can live. 2 weeks is ok, because i'm in France and can go anywhere at least if the city is big enough. But because of my illness, i can't have a job. And i can't find one in 1 weeks. I get ""paid"" 900€/months to help me live because i can't work. 
But people who sell appartment are recluant to give keys to a guy who can't have a job even if he has enough money to pay every month.

Illness mmh, covered up by drugs, but it look like schizophrenia, or paranoid autism with OCD.
PTSD and social phobia.


My Family.

My family is clearly abusing me emotionaly. I can't rely on them. On top of that, some wan't me in jail or in a psychiatric hospital.

My mother can give me a litle bit of money, she has a lot, but she is abusing me also, making me a child when i'm feeling bad and making me feeling bad when i do things like a real men.
Atm, my family all making me crazy. I did 3 psychotic crisis in 2 week because of them and i was stable for 1 year before.

I have no friends, no girlfriend, nothing. I'm alone.
Not fully alone, i have a therapist, he help me but he can't do much 

I really need to find a appartment and do my stuff.


What i wan't.

I have many buisness idea on the internet. I need to launch some ASAP. I don't wan't to be seen like a dysfunctional men my whole life.

And i wan't to be free of some drugs.

First phenibut, i wan't to quit phenibut. But i'm afraid that even if i slow tapper 50mg/day i will have a rough time coming of (it potentiate valium so i will have to slowly go up on valium while reducing it)
I think i will also slowly reduce caffeine. Like 100mg/week at the same time.

But at the moment, i'm just destroyed because of lack of sleep, instable emotions (family), fear of being lock up in jail, fear of being killed by my father, or whatever.

Today was really fucking hard. For the past two weeks, my cravings to use again we’re coming on strong and I was doing my best to ignore them until today. Today I caved in and I bought half a gram. I didn’t finish it and I threw the rest away. I felt awful, my heart was racing and I felt like I couldn’t sit still. I was so uncomfortable and just wanted it to be over just as soon as it started. I left work early because I felt sick and I felt like I need to rest. Well the craving came back and was stronger this time. So I went and bought another half a gram. I did half of it and flushed the rest. The weird thing about it, the second time I knew I just needed to feel the thrill of buying it and doing the first little bit. Then I was done. After I flushed it, I immediately wanted it back. But I knew that it would just make me feel worse than I already did. I was so mad at myself until I admitted what I did to a friend. What I didn’t realize was that I needed to have this relapse. It was to remind and reassure myself that I would never touch this shit again. I spent four years on a medication that turned me into someone I didn’t recognize and during that time I got hooked on coke. After 3 months of no coke or that medication, I guess I needed to know for sure that this is definitely something I don’t like to do. It’s hard building a life and a personality for four years that’s not even who you are or someone you think you would ever be. So I’m starting over as an entirely different person and I think I had to relapse to know that the new me isn’t interested in doing drugs ever. I don’t even like to drink anymore. There is so much to discover and learn about myself that I honestly don’t know what to do with myself besides work, eat and sleep.

946,addiction,2020/02/27,"advice needed? okay so me and my boyfriend have been hanging out with this dude recently that my boyfriend used to work with (i’m gunna refer to him as J). he was super chill and smoked weed, which was cool to us because my boyfriend (i’m gunna refer to HIM as A) and i are pretty much self proclaimed “stoners”. 

at first we were smoking like one blunt with him and then heading out, then his girlfriend started hanging out with us too so we would just hang out longer. i became really good friend with her really fast and we just had this dope ass little friend group. about a week ago though, shit completely hit the fan and they broke up which i think made J snap. 

since i met A, he and I had done coke together a LOT. i wouldn’t call it an addiction in our case because we go weeks at a time without doing it, and then do it for pretty much a week straight, then stop again for like two months. we introduced J to coke, not thinking it would turn into him wanting to get coke every other day. after he left his girlfriend, he started selling stuff in his room to pay for it, but since me and A stopped doing it again, he hasn’t been able to. now he’s spending all of his money on ecstasy and i KNOW he’s abusing it. he’s been taking two 200mg exos every six hours. after looking at r/mdma i noticed how many people go months between rolls. he’s now waiting until his come down to start rolling again. 

i know that maybe it’s not my place, but i don’t know what to do. i don’t feel right with myself just sitting to the side and letting him do this. what should i say, if anything? what should i do to try to him to stop? he literally sold his cellphone today to buy more.",344,0.0,0,0.0

She wants to quit and asked for my help, but about a day in she starts messaging me to get them back. On the first night I went over to spend time with her, she had kept some regular weed and was high when I came over (not great but I didn't make a fuss about that). 

She talks a lot about not being able to sleep and the synthetic weed vape ""knocks her brain out"". She also uses a bunch of sleeping pills but they don't seem to work. I say no and stay with her for a few hours before going home. 

Night 2 she messages me wanting the vape back but doesn't want me to come over. This time more manic then before and it seems she hasn't slept much in the past 2 days. 

My question is, am I going about this the right way? She seems very half in half out. She wants to quit (when she's sober) but she can't seem to do it. Are these just withdrawal symptoms and it'll get easier or is synthetic weed something else entirely weird. A drug that knocks your brain out can't be good for you and I know she uses it a lot. She says she's not feeling any withdrawals so she doesn't need to quit. But If she needs it to sleep then surely that's a dependancy. I also don't know if I want to destroy the vape and juice.

I’m worried about him lately as he has been trying to get off drugs and alcohol, and trying to live a bit more of a wholesome lifestyle as he had a bit of a cocaine problem for a few years. He only really does it now when he drinks, which he never wants to when we’re together...but when his friends ask him to hangout, it’s only ever involving drinking and going out. He’s told all his “friends” he’s trying to stop but none of them seem to really care. 

He’s usually pretty good and says no, but a few of his friends have started ripping into him saying that he doesn’t have time for them anymore and I think he feels pressured into doing it, because he doesn’t want to loose friends. 

I don’t know how to approach the situation because I love him and want him to hang out with whoever he wants, but I’m also sick of seeing his friends treat him like shit (in my opinion) and not respect him or his want to live a different kind of life..

953,addiction,2020/02/28,"""If you have to ask, you should have your answer."" Hey all. Thank you for taking the time to read this, I'm a bit lost.

I'm trying to be honest with myself about having an addictive mindset, and I can't tell whether or not I'm just lying to myself to make myself feel better. I've recently started to get into Blackjack, and after a couple of months of studying, I've been able to keep a pretty strict schedule as far as winning or losing. So far I'm up a good amount, but my visits to the casino have also gone from 1-2 times a month, to 1-2 times a week, to 3-4 times a week. Some of it has to do with the fact that I'm winning (I set out an amount for the year, and if I dip below it, I'm done until next year), but I'm wondering if I'm just taking this a step too far... I feel like because I'm winning, it's justifying going so often, and I wonder if that's the start of a problem. I'm trying to see if this can become a career, so I'm sort of treating it like that as far as the time I'm putting in to leaning my craft, but again, I'm just wondering if this is starting to become a problem. 

Is the fact that I'm setting hard limits for myself enough of an indication that I don't have a problem? At what point does this become a problem, outside of simply ""betting too much money""? What are some indication that this is becoming a problem if I keep winning at the pace I have been? It's like... just because I win/I'm not losing money I don't have, doesn't mean a problem isn't forming, right?

I guess I'm just trying to figure out what some warming signs to look out for are. I'm wondering if my ""system"" is just a justification for a growing problem, or if it's showing that I do have the ability to let limits, thus showing that I have this under control...

I'm sorry if I'm not explaining myself clearly, just let me know if there are some more details I can share to get a clearer answer.",406,0.0,0,0.0

955,addiction,2020/02/28,"i want to tell my boyfriend about my coke addiction im going to start off with saying that my boyfriend is straight edge. he doesn’t drink, do any form of nicotine, or any kinds of drugs, it’s something his stuck by for the last two years and he plans on never doing any sort of harmful stuff to his body. he knows i occasionally smoke and he’s for the most part okay with it. 
so to start from the beginning i first tried coke when i was around 17, it was something i was offered and i thought why not. i never did it again until recently. i’m now 20 years old and most of my co workers do coke, and a lot of it. i started by just bumming from them to buying my own grams. it wasn’t a problem at first and i was only occasionally doing key bumps at work just to get through my day. it’s been a few weeks and now i do multiple lines a day and if it weren’t for me living with my boyfriend i could probably do grams a day. i love coke so much. i love the rush it gives me. i love how im not hungry or tired when i do it. even if i don’t have a reason to do it, i’ll still snort lines all through the night. 
my boyfriend found out that my co workers do coke, at first he told me that he would be devastated if i ever did anything like that. then a few weeks pass by and he starts asking me if i’m doing coke, of course i say no. when he asked i didn’t feel as if it were a problem and i had been telling myself that if it became a problem then i would tell my boyfriend so he could help me. there have been multiple occasions where i just want to blurt out that i have a coke problem. i was so so so close to doing it the other day when we had an argument but i ended up just keeping quiet. today he told me that if he ever found i was doing coke or that i brought it into our home, that he would break the lease with me and never talk to me again. for him to say that was kinda scary because this man loves me so much, i see it, our families see it and our friends see it and for him to say he’d leave me was sort of a shock to me. now i feel as my coke problem gets worse (because im too weak and can not stop on my own) and i really need help, that he won’t help me. has anyone gone through a problem similar to mine with a significant other? i don’t want my boyfriend to leave me but i also really want to let him know before it gets out of hand",515,0.0,0,0.0

My mom would judge me for not becoming what she wanted me to become and I would judge her for letting herself go and succumbing to her demons. 

I have a hard time accepting that alcohol is a drug. I mean, it's like socially acceptable and everyone does it, but it ruins lives. Somehow it's become apart of my identity. I love shows where the main character is an alcoholic because then it makes me feel normal and even like I'm somehow special. Except when I drink I tend to be more than overly eager to do coke or snort anything that will make my head feel normal. Drinking is a slippery slope. Each day I tell myself it's my last day of drinking except it never is. ""Tomorrow you will go to the gym and get back into your routine."" Ha.

964,addiction,2020/02/29,"Addicted to huffing (serious) Just made a throw away account as I don’t want to use my main to make this post. 

I’m going to give a bit of back story, what I do, my reasons why etc

So basically it all started when I was 15, to keep it short my friend showed me that with a can of lynx deodorant if you place your sleeve over your mouth and spray the can into you mouth through the sleeve you can get “high”, I tried it and it did feel nice. I did it on occasion but after a while I sort of stopped.

A few years go by and I remember what it was like, the only thing I had on hand was a can of “Sure anti-perspirant” so I used that, and the feeling is indescribable,

The hallucinations were amazing (but sometimes scary) and it was so unreal. I was hooked. I began buying 1 can every second day and in the morning I would huff, and I created my own world, when I would start huffing I would have YouTube on and I would be “teleported” to another world, it was the strangest yet most wonderful sensation ever. 

Then I started buying more, 2 then 3, and now 4 cans every second day and I can’t get enough of it, the world my brain creates when I’m huffing is so much better than the one I currently live. The last time I huffed was about 4 hours ago and part of the reason I’m not doing it now is because I ran out.

The reason I’m making this post is because of what happened earlier. I was huffing and in my own world when all of the sudden there was a loud bang in my house (one of my siblings) it made me jump and when it happened I got a super sharp pain in my chest and it lasted for about 5 minutes. Stupidly I continued huffing after that.

I read online that when you are huffing and you get a sudden shock there is a high chance you could flat out die. And that’s why I’m posting this,

I can’t stop, the world I created is too good to leave. But I know I need to stop. But I don’t know where to begin. It’s taking a lot to not ask for money and go to the shop to buy more.

967,addiction,2020/02/29,"[LONG][TW: Stims] Slippery slope of stims, need advice/help TL;DR: slippery slope of stimulant binges has fucked my self control and moderate use of stimulants to treat my ADHD. Need help reclaiming my discipline.

So I got BAD ADHD and have been unmedicated up until I got Vyvanse in August. Before that I had fucked with Adderall, Vyvanse, and 2FMA (fuckkkk that). It was really effective and I got good grades in some really hard classes!!! However with this Dr Jekyll comes a Mr Hyde which is really fuckin tricky to deal with. Might be kinda long for obvious reasons.

So I really like fucking stimulants. Probably because they enable me to achieve my potential, make me feel smart and on top of it, you know the drill. I self medicated 2FMA last year cuz it’s cheap and I didn’t have time to go through the long ass ADHD diagnosis process till summer. I fiended like a motherfucker every time I took it because I was so scared of losing the euphoria so I would redose a few times more than I probably should have. However I never pulled all nighters and only ever took it orally. 

2FMA runs out, summer comes, get diagnosed and on Vyvanse, of which I immediately popped two of upon picking up my first prescription. Chasing that god damn dragon. Spoiler: didn’t catch the dragon because that mother fucker will always outrun me. 

So that day passes and I take it as intended for a while, always getting a tiny touch of euphoria followed by some anxiety and then a flatline of focus. I wish it just didn’t have any euphoria because that is the source of my fucking problems. Anyways eventually I get hungover and decide to take 3, fixes the hangover and gets me social and productive at work. Go home for lunch and pop 3 more cuz fuck it why not. Speed even harder And yet am still unsatisfied, you see where this is goin?

So I go back to taking it like I’m supposed to, doing good as fuck in school, etc, then my doc ups my dose, gives me an early refill. Awesome! Now I have extra and of course I immediately take all of the extra over the course of the day. Every time saying it would be my last one or some other bullshit fake rationalization. 

Up dose again (to my current dose), early refill again, binge again. Keep in mind I would tell no one that I’m doing this shit. Every time my total would be a little higher than before. Fight with girlfriend more and more as my brain is gradually being rewired to always be seeking a high of some sort. Binge at her house, binge at my hometown house. But now it’s to the point that I don’t want it to end so badly that I keep going through the night, like 3 all nighters a month. Not good for the body or the mind. Start feeling an urge to binge every time it kicks in.

Suffer some shitty comedowns, especially on Christmas Day after I wasted Christmas Eve. Stopped for a bit then. I have no problem completely abstaining from it provided I don’t have anything to do that requires intense focus. Went through hella withdrawal, slept 12 hours a day, etc. But they passed and I felt free and refreshed. If only I never had to have school work bullshit I could just banish Vyvanse to the shadow realm. 

However, I take it again when school starts, immediately binge. Feel like shit again day after; the usual. 

Back to the grind, back to prescription doses. However I cave and binge out of fucking nowhere just because i felt like it. All nighter on a Tuesday. Girlfriends family invites me to dinner. Look like shit, feel like shit. Do this two more times, always finding some justification for it, always regretting it after. After the third impulse binge I was just so fuckin sick of it that I made new rules for Vyvanse (which I broke today) where basically I only take it on weds thurs fri sun, as to keep it perfectly balanced, as all things should be. I did damn good however today I took some for my test and ended up blowing through the rest of my stash. And here I am disappointed in myself, finally telling somebody and asking for help.

Honestly, this shit hasn’t fucked anyone over, made my life go to shit, or gotten me in trouble, but it is pretty damn close with the way it’s been going recently.

Even before this ""rockstar lifestyle"" started, I daily smoked weed for two years and take atleast every 7 days one or two lsd trips for about 1 year now.
I guess that's not too bad, but since this constant traveling started alcohol, mdma and cocaine joined.

Because nearly every show is a party and has also an aftershowparty we or me can basicly party on every occasion with free booze and rich people wanting to give you cocaine because they liked our show.

I've gone along with that and this means I sometimes drink and snort every day and take mdma maybe every week for two or three tablets.
Along with the over consumption which was there before

Idk it just doesn't feel right and I started worrying about my health and how long I can do this, because I feel quite good actually.
I follow a vegan diet and do alot of exercise buy ye, it seems weird and worrying to me...

I'm obsessed with the 60s/70s and kinda got the self-destructive attitude of this time, also celebrate it actually.

971,addiction,2020/03/01,"Adult child living with a drug addicted parent Hello! I want to say first that I don’t entirely know what I want from this post. I guess I’m just hoping to get this off my chest and see if anyone else is dealing with or has dealt with something similar. I have looked online and, unfortunately, haven’t found much about how adult children can help drug addicted parents — it’s often the other way around.

Anyway, I (28F) am my mother’s (59F) only child. Her parents and siblings have all died, making me her closest and, honestly, only living relative. My father is currently in an assisted living facility, having had several medical issues in the past few years. I bought a house two years ago and I live in it with my mother.

I have known for several years my mother abuses drugs. I believe I first saw her doing cocaine when I was in elementary school. Since then, I have caught her smoking meth or have found drug paraphernalia several times. She has always been relatively secretive about it. If I do catch her, she denies, denies, denies. We did have a bit of a breakthrough shortly after we moved into this new house. She finally admitted to being a drug addict. She said she used to do cocaine and meth in the past, but was no longer using. I’ve found evidence to suggest otherwise since then.

Today, I walked in on her friend with a pipe in her hand in my living room. My mother was in the same room. I didn’t see anything on her. I freaked out and asked the friend and this random dude with her to leave. My mom denied seeing them using drugs.

Again, I’m not sure what I want from posting this. I am just frustrated. I don’t know what kind of support I can give my mother. She keeps denying currently using. I want to trust her. Am I being paranoid? I love my mother dearly and she is such a kind, giving person. I just want to help her. (I also don’t want drugs in my house)

Context: 

Since relationship advice removed my post I'm trying it here: 

My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year, he is addicted to alcohol. I live at his place because I got kicked out by my folks when our relationship started. At first, I did not know his alcohol problem was such a major issue.

Everything was great. He was super lovely and bought me, for instance, flowers every week. My mom and dad thought he was too old, and he was going after me for a different reason. I kept saying it was nonsense and I have my own life to live. But as soon as I moved in with him it all changed. It started slowly but soon it took over my whole life.

He hits me when drunk and gets mad at me for no reason at all. I think I hear him shouting slut more than my actual name. As my dad and mom didn’t want me in the house whilst dating him because of the age gap, I feel like I can’t go to them for help.

Last time I saw them I was wearing a scarf because of the choke bruises in my neck, he was with me as well. We were having dinner, I excused myself and went to the kitchen, my dad followed up pulled my scarf and saw the bruises. He said something along the lines of ‘’For fuck's sake, who did that to you’’. So I lied and made up a story about having a fight at a bar with a woman. He bought it. (I think).

I feel like I’m constantly swallowing my pride saying everything is all great, as I’m afraid of the ‘’I told you so” leaving my dad's mouth. I feel like if I tell my folks they will get more angry and disappointed than they already are.

I rely on my boyfriend financially because he doesn’t allow me to get a job. It’s not only physical and verbal abuse. When I say no to having s\*x, it will happen anyway. I have no one to talk to about this.

I misused coughing medicine, amphetamine, benzos and cocaine as well but I don't consider myself addicted to those.

But I grew a serious addiction to alcohol causing me to suffer an epileptic seizure leading to 5 broken bones in my spine where the nerves go through. Thanks God I ain't paralized and can still walk.

So I am dead sober for almost one year but I shifted my addiction to gambling on slot machines and this is so fucking dangerous and expensive.
I receive welfare money but still I have managed to lose like a fuck ton of money for gambling.

I guess I need a separate therapy only for the gambling addiction.
I left my old environment to stay sober and now I am just on my own so I can't continue to waste my little money on slot machines.

981,addiction,2020/03/01,"Quitting a different way I am a 28 year old male, highly 'functioning' and professional (at least, that's the face I put on during the 9-5). I've had an unhealthy relationship with drink and various drugs throughout my life. In the last 4 years, cocaine and booze have been my vice. 

I've tried to quit plenty, only to relapse. My Dad, during his recovery from his alcohol addiction said to me this, ""there's no such thing as someone who used to be an alcoholic, there's only sober alcoholics"". So I guess for people like me, who are addicts, the battle is never over, you can never stop trying to be sober, and the second you thinn you're over it, is the most dangerous moment that will probably ensue a relapse.

I don't want to keep relapsing, because one day I know it will kill me, I'll die of a heart attack in a cocaine and alcohol fuelled night of chaos. Because of my addiction, I have ended up getting myself into a situation once that saw me end up in intensive care for a month, a wheelchair for two months, and I still have a long road of physio ahead of me. I've been hospitalized on 3 occasions in total because of situations I found myself in, after having got drunk, or drunk and high.

This time I'm trying it a different way. I'm going to take to journaling, writing down my thoughts, discussing it with people maybe in a similar situation.

My current part time job for the past ~5 years on and off involves playing a popular game that has a gambling scene. You can build/buy certain accounts and calculate odds so that they’re in your favor. The game has an economy that is easily transferrable to real money. Shitty streaks/“bad beats” happen, but this is not my problem..

Sometimes when I get streaked and lose a lot of money; or simply there is no action and no one is betting, I get restless and irritated. Tons of people partake in a 50/50 gambling aspect of the game. When I’m having one of these rough days I’ll head over and start gambling instead of making sure the odds are in my favor. I’ll lose anywhere from $500-5k in a night and rarely win. As many of you know, the times you do win fuel your urge to go back and ultimately have you lose. 

I’ve lost somewhere in the neighborhood of $60k on this game, but you can make so much money so quickly that I convince my sick mind it’s a smart idea each time I resort to gambling.

I recently downloaded the pokerstars app. Saw an advertisement with an initial match deposit, and loaded in $25. Lost and won a couple spin and go poker tournaments. On my 3rd $25 3 player tournament, the prize pool landed on $625. The website says the odds of this happening are 1,000/1,000,000 (0.1%). I ended up winning. 

Told customer support I don’t trust myself and to let me withdraw immediately instead of in 48h. Withdrew the money.

After the despot hit yesterday I started adding more money back and playing more tournaments, chasing my high. Poker with an aspect of spinning a prize wheel to win up to a million dollars? What a crazy high, how could I say no? I’m only risking 1/25 of what I made after all.

Loss after loss, bad beat after bad beat, hypnotic deposit after hypnotic deposit, I lost the whole $625 back. I only won a handful out of all the rest. It felt like the app had it out for me. The craziest bs happening, it was making me feel insane. I can’t believe I just lost all of that money back in two days.

I need to quit. If I just worked my job without resulting to this hypnotizing headspace I’d potential riches I would be well off right now. I want to quit and be over with this. I feel disgusted with myself after every loss, only to be fueled by the memorized of past wins to continue in this sick behavior.

I still feel like chucking money 50/50. I still feel like depositing more money on pokerstars. How do I get rid of these sick desires?

WHAT I HAVE LEARNED (thus far)

1.

anger is not sustainable (you cannot sustain (active) anger over long periods of time. it is exhausting, will make you physically, mentally and worst yet, spiritually sick.) it can also weaken your resolve in abstaining from substances.


2.

   a.   argumentation is a skill, being argumentative is a sign/red flag

    b.   a sign/red flag is much like an old fashioned theatre marquee flashing ""UNSTABLE""


3.

you can deflect, deny, filibuster, accuse, attack, obstruct and continue to act out,  fearfully... but it won't change what the Truth is.

ultimately however, we make our own decisions and thusly are responsible for each and every one of them.

deflection promotes the disease of addiction whereas self reflection and introspection promotes wellness in all areas of life.


4.

(struggling with) spirituality/belief system ~ burning bushes *rarely* happen... even in the bible.

because HP (a higher power,  greater thank you) sometimes speaks in whispers, we must listen... in order to receive, learn, practice and pass on to another, we must truly be quiet and listen.

quiet your mind, your heart... let your spirit settle... and Listen. Learn. Live, and Live Well.

997,addiction,2020/03/02,"Looking for input for my thesis Hey everyone,

Sorry if this post is not appropriate for this subreddit, so please delete if needed. I’m a student from the Netherlands and currently working on my thesis. In short it’s about what can we do for those people that are directly affected by someone else’s addiction (partner, kids, parents etc.). Nowadays there are quite a few solutions for people that have an addiction, but way less for the people around them. My studies are related to communication, multimedia and design, so I’m looking at it from that point of view.

My question is if some people (preferably those affected by the addiction of someone else) are willing to give their opinion and input on the things I’m working on. Of course everything will be completely anonymous. Things can range from some rapid questions about small things and maybe even helping me test my digital prototype.

I've recently become very emptionally invested with a girl who has identified as a love (and sex) addict. 
After reading up on this particular addiction (I'm recovering from heroin myself) I've become more knowledgable about the subject and even have made similar comparison in order to identify with her. 

My question is this:
Is it possible for her to recover from a love addiction while taking part in a monogamous relationship?

Just trying to see if this is something we can work through together or if I'm just wasting my time.

Then I bought a pack of disposable vapes. “Just to curb the stress.” Now I have a refillable pod vape and I didn’t even feel the slide downhill happening. As I plugged the thing in to charge, I just started feeling like I couldn’t face my own relapse anymore.

It's the result of 25 years of the UK NHS ignoring my complaints of bowel pain until finally they opened me up and the consultant surgeon responded with ""Oh........ fucking shit"".

So I'm on 150mg of morphine a day, even though everyone from me to my specialists know that it's the worst thing for me. Chronic Pain Syndrome the more strong analgesics you take the worse the pain gets. So over the next six months, I'm going to be weaned off.

Now my actual problem. I have panic attacks that lead to seizures. Bad seizures. My medics will give me 10x 5mg diazepam twice a year. It's not enough. So I have an online plug who is fucking awesome and supplies me with Serbian (Galenika) alprazolam (1mg), diazepam (10mg) and clonazepam (2mg). Alongside this, he can also get me Lyrica (400mg). It works. It really does, but I am aware of just how short the window is between working and addiction. I have a psychiatrist next week and I'm in two minds whether to tell him/her about this.

If I tell my GP what I'm doing they'll cut me off and never, EVER prescribe controlled drugs again. However, my shrink could find the fact that clonazepam works to stop my seizures (alprazolam is NOT legal in the UK).

What do I do?

I've had to destroy my career. My wife is a caregiver and all I do is cause her pain and hurt and although she refuses to agree I know I am dragging her down and she would be better off without me.

I had two accidental ODs in January from morphine and alprazolam mixed with a serious lung infection. I also discovered I am allergic to Narcan so when they hit me with it I went from a thready respiratory rate to my lung shutting down. After the second I'm ashamed to admit I was angry and upset that I woke up.

I knew early on that she had recovered from a cocaine addiction. The last time had been several years before we had even met. She went cold turkey and hasn't touched it in about ten years. Other then some shitty (former) friends offering her some early on in our relationship this issue has never really come up.

However, the other day my wife confided in me that she still thinks of it often. She must have seen the look of pure fear on my face because she quickly assured she she'd never, ever, ever ever touch the stuff again.

However I can't stop worrying about this. For example, shortly after this conversation we went to see the movie Birds of Prey. And there is a scene (no spoilers) where Harley Quinn is in the middle of a fight, a bunch of bags of cocaine were shot open, Harley breathes the stuff in, gets a rush of energy and wins the fight.

Two things, it sicked me to my stomach to see this drug portrayed in such a positive light and second, I couldn't help but worry/fear of how this was affecting my wife.

I honestly hate how nicotine makes me feel. Nauseated, dizzy/lihhtheaded, and unfocused. It practically feels like the same feeling I get whenever my iron or blood sugar is too low. Idk how anyone could crave that or get addicted to that feeling. Some people say cigarettes/using nicotine is relaxing or calming but I've always found the opposite to be true when i tried it. It didn't make me feel any different emotionally other than ""Why did I just do that to my lungs?"". 

I have always had it in my head that I have an extremely high potential for addiction especially since practically everyone who is related to me by blood, and most of the people I grew up around were an addict at some point or are currently an addict to something. The person who fathered me was an addict to multiple drugs including cocaine and meth, and my mom used to dabble with drugs a but when she was younger (LSD, pills to my knowledge) and she drank. She still smokes cigs and now has prescription medication but I don't think she's addicted to any of them (I hope not)

I used to be addicted to internet gaming and painting my nails (seriously it was like 4x a day for months, my mom had to tell me to stop) and I've struggled with pornography addiction since around age 9.

I’m on disability for bipolar disorder and my chronic pain, so I’m stuck inside all day long, and it can get crazy boring. I also have PTSD and the oxy can stave off a panic attack.

My doctor prescribed a slightly higher amount of pills last month - 10 extra a month, so it’s not like I can massively abuse them. I still have more flexibility now though on how and when I take them. It seems like once I took it for emotional/psychological reasons one time, it was easier to do a second time, then a third, then it’s a semi-regular thing.

I've been off alcohol for almost 3 months now. My life has drastically improved and I'm really happy that I made the choice to stop. I was never the type to ""black-out"" or lose my job or lose loved ones or ruin my health. I never drank at work or had financial issues but I was using alcohol for the wrong reasons are was starting to head down the bad road really quickly. I attend AA meetings once a week (which I've really learned to enjoy after some difficult initial meetings) and enjoy them, although I'm not doing the twelve steps and such. My life couch has said to me ""you're not an alcoholic, you just need to check yourself"" and according to members of AA I probably am an alcoholic if I think so. It's all a bit confusing, but I'm happy not drinking. I'm like, REALLY happy.

The thing is, I'm off on a big, overseas holiday later this year with my mom. She's getting old and I want to spoil her and such. I really want to do things like try the wine, the beer, the gin where I'm going because I doubt I'll ever go there again. Before things got bad, I was heavily into gastronomy and tastes and enjoyed alcohol in a positive manner and mind-frame. I feel that I can enjoy a few drinks while I'm away and I do trust myself. I'll also be around people that support me and trust me. I also don't intend on drinking when I get home, and I know I won't.

I just wanted some thoughts and opinions on this. I've brought it up at AA and the whole thing was brushed off and left me feeling a bit shameful of the whole thing. I struggle with the idea of restricting myself sometimes, specially when a situation seems fine and safe.

1051,addiction,2020/03/05,"Concerns Regarding Addiction and My Physical Dependency to Substances and Xanax  Hi all,

New here and looking for some guidance/reassurance. Feel free to skip right now to my question regarding my xanax addiction, or continue below for context about myself: 

I'm a 22 y/o college student w/ ADHD who has had a problem with substances since Jan, 2018 (following a break-up). I am not depressed (I think), but I do have a pretty bad case of social anxiety. For the past two years, I have drank, abused weed, abused Adderall (prescribed &amp; snorted it), been on and off nicotine, dabbled with coke, mixed drugs, glorified drug-use, been 24/7 sleep-deprived, and until recently, started abusing Xanax. I don't think I've been straight up sober for more than two weeks consecutively for the past two years. I have been aware of my substance problem for over a year, and now that it is reaching a breaking point, I realize I HAVE to change (I've been trying on my own for over a year). Combined with my four concussions, my substance abuse, poor health, and bad habits are just about to prove natural selection still exists for an employed (offer is to start this June), financially-dependent, white male. I wholeheartedly believe I am approaching the point of no return; so, I have decided it is time to seek help. 

Let's get to the point:

I have used Xanax around 5-7 days per week ranging from 0.75mg to 4.5mg for about 6 weeks. I use it for just about anything - to party, get a decent sleep, help me speak better in front of my classmates, or just mellow out. 

Here's my main question:

Have I been taking Xanax long and consistently enough that I will experience *physical* withdrawal symptoms if I go cold turkey? I can't seem to pinpoint a timeframe from my research. I'm kinda scared bc. I've read withdrawal symptoms include seizures. If I have been using it long enough, is there an optimized ""homemade"" method to tapering off? Not quite sure what to do here bc. one day I'll take half, the next a quarter, and the next a bar and a half (dosages are pretty random).

Here's my plan (which I would appreciate your thoughts on as well): 

I'm setting up an appointment with a therapist tomorrow through a school program for either Friday or as soon as I get back from spring break, which is March 7-14. I've decided this is the time to detox bc. I'll be visiting my sister in Florida, so I can literally go cold turkey given the environment. The plan is to exercise and meditate every day. Now, when I get back to school, there's a concert on the 14th that I'm definitely drinking w/ friends before... The plan is to keep it to JUST alcohol. I'm sorta viewing it as an incentive to stay sober for spring break. If all goes to plan, I will then remain sober for 30 days and focus on catching up in school. I will also try to use Adderall as it should be used, in a very limited and controlled fashion. However, I want your opinion on how I should move forward with my addy use as well (given my tendency to crave other drugs on it). Even though I have ADHD, I don't know if addy should be in my life, period... I feel like its time to ""outgrow"" my ADHD and train my focus via meditation. 

In conclusion:

That's about all I can share given my exam in 3 hours, which is gonna make or (probably) break my economics minor... What do you think about my concerns surrounding my Xanax use and my planned next steps? Thank you in advance for help - it feels good just to get this off my chest!!",667,0.0,0,0.0

1059,addiction,2020/03/06,"Should I hang out with my old drinking buddy? Hi r/addiction,

Seeking some advice. In college, \[friend\] and I were best friends. Though it wasn't the only thing we bonded over, alcohol was a major component of our times together. Looking back, much of this was 'problem drinking,' (binges, blackouts, etc.) but the feeling was 'hey, it's college.'

Toward the end of college, I had a series of epiphanies that (thankfully) steered me toward the path of self-care. Today, I drink infrequently and in moderation. \[Friend\] experienced no such reorientation; if anything, he doubled down, 'came to terms with' being an alcoholic, and I believe has now picked up a coke and cigarette habit to boot. We drifted apart pretty rapidly after college, due in part I think to me not wanting to party like I used to, though there are other factors at play too (physical distance, \[friend\]'s general psychological journey).

I want to reconnect with \[friend\]. He is a special person and means a lot to me. Also, if possible, I want to support him turning away from his self-destructive lifestyle. I feel partially responsible, given that I played a great part in ramping up these behaviors then stepped off the train when I'd had enough. Given his current lifestyle and our past together, I can't imagine a way to spend non-awkward quality time together without drinking. He would likely be drinking, so if I abstain, it will feel pointed and judgemental. But drinking with him would feel irresponsible, given that drinking is an addiction for him. Yet I know social isolation and/or being surrounded only by other users can play a major part in continuing an addiction. I'm wondering now if the benefits of reconnection, of reminding him that he has a friend and a safe space in me, outweigh the harms of drinking (in moderation) with him. After all, he's drinking anyway, with or without me. It's possible he will never stop drinking; does this mean I have to never again experience our friendship? Yes, of course, if our friendship is real we should be able to have it without alcohol; but I don't think he's ready for that at this point. Having a nice time together seems like the best way back into his heart, the only way I see to help him take the first step toward health.

1064,addiction,2020/03/06,"Addicted to soda again, feel utterly sick and awful So I realize this isn’t nearly as serious as some other addictions like drug:alcohol abuse but this is an addiction of mine that I thought I had conquered and now it’s back.

I began drinking soda when I was very young, and it was probably most of what I drank until I was in high school and decided to quit cold turkey for weight reasons. I lost a ton of weight (honestly didn’t even need to, but I was going through a phase where I hated my body and was obsessed with being as skinny as possible), got much healthier, and even was at a point when drinking any soda made me sick. That sick feeling slowly went away, but I still never drank any soda for years and years.

I started dating my boyfriend who regularly drinks soda, to which I have no problem, except I started asking for sips here and there, and that turned into asking for more sips and now.... I find myself drinking 1 soda a day on my own, maybe 2 if I over do it.

I suppose I can attribute my relapse partially because of the birth of my now two month old baby. Toward the end of my pregnancy I was so tired and sick of the pain and stress that comes with being heavily pregnant that I thought to myself, “Oh what the hell, I’m miserable, I’ll indulge myself.” And once my baby was born, it turned into, “I am exhausted and in severe pain and I don’t care anymore, GIVE ME THE SODA.”

I feel so crappy every time I drink it but I can’t stop. It doesn’t even taste that good to be honest, but I just want it. The amount of sugar in it makes me feel revolting and I feel like stopping but I end up grabbing another can the next day. Has anyone else gone through this? Is this just a phase due to stress that will eventually subside? Or am I looking at the beginnings of a new addiction? I am seriously concerned about gaining weight and my health now that I’m drinking soda so regularly. Should I just try what worked before? I replaced soda with milk (I know some of y’all think milk is gross but it worked). Are there any other ways to combat soda addiction?",414,0.0,0,0.0

I remember going into high school, a decent student with hopes for the future.

I thought it seemed so cool, being a guy who smokes blunts and pops pills and snorts lines here and there. I started where a lot of people do with weed, and I stuck there for a while. But soon enough it turned into psychedelics, and then molly, and then opiates, then coke, etc. By the time I realized I might be making a mistake, I was HOPELESSLY addicted to several different substances. Idk if no one ever rlly told me this or I was just too damn young and stupid to hear it but as soon as drugs starting being my main source of “fun,” my brain was rewired. 5 years later and I still can’t think of having a good time without getting absolutely smashed, baked, cranked, or something else stupid.

I got sober back in November 2018 but I relapsed on marijuana in the summer of 2019. I had this same feeling back then that led me to use again.
I’m having a really hard time lately. I haven’t been getting to meetings, I’m working the steps (on step 8) and I am working around 50 hours a week between 3 jobs and still not really making ends meet. I feel too emotionally exhausted from all my jobs to get to meetings even though I know meetings would help my spiritual fitness and all that. Not only that but I feel isolated from most of my friends because I don’t see them as often because I’m so busy and I think a lot of us just naturally fell apart since the much less time consuming periods of early sobriety.
I do suffer from anxiety and depression and my medication works pretty well but they might need adjustment. That may have a contributing factor to my still fairly unstable moods.
I need advice. Anyone else know this feeling? How’d you get through it? Do I really just need to pull my head out of ass, get more humble, and get to more meetings? Or is this some kind of multi-factor thing...should I look at new/better jobs?

( that is close to half of what he took home last year) He lies and takes money for our family. I am very allergic to the smoke and it is negatively affecting my health. He knows what he is doing to my health and promises to stop.  I called off the wedding before were married multiple times. He always promised that he would stop. He begged for me to marry him. That he would never do it again. Then he says he needs it. Then he claims he didn't spend that much. He refuses to believe it. But the bank records prove it. 

In December he spent almost $2,000 on weed and didn't even get a Christmas present for me or an anniversary present. Nothing.  Weed was more important.  He keeps crying and making promises. But he never follows through.  

I have had to contribute every cent of my income and not be able to spend any money just to pay bills.  I needed a root canal and had to wait to get it done because he was spending the money on weed. He knew and promised he would stop, but of course he doesn't.  

He will get hundreds of dollars of weed and it is gone in 24 hours.  

My physical health is getting really bad. I have autoimmune issues and and allergic to the smoke. My allergies got worse after we got married. But that shouldn't master because he promised before we got married he would not smoke. 

I have tried to help him. I have tried to be tough. I have tried everything in between. He just won't stop. Meanwhile, my boss is worried about me because of the stress (and she didn't even know exactly what is happening). My doctors have told me I can't be around the smoke and he knows that. He just doesn't even shower when he comes in.  The smoke clings to him.  

Things are desperate. We have a court date next month. I wish we were not here. It sucks. 

And to add insult to injury, I had been receiving $28,000 a year in maintenance and I have that up to marry him.  I barely make mote than that.  I will have to give up my home because i can't afford it.  But the little that he gives covers hisinsurance, phone, has, extra food costs, and some extra... But the little extra that he duress contribute is small and not worth my physical and emotional health. 

I just need support.  I never thought I'd deal with Ann addict. I didn't realize he was addicted before. I thought it was just recreational... That is what he told me. But now he does admit addiction, but he does not want to change. 

I am physically hurting ( from the smoke affecting my health) and emotionally hurting from all the lies.  

I know some Will say that $1000 a month on weed is nor an addiction, but it is for him. He will do anything to get weed.  He would spend more if he could.  I have to pay bills the moment his partial paycheck hits or account or it is gone for more weed.  He had some money go to his account that I cannot get to.

1077,addiction,2020/03/07,"Losing people around me Sorry if this isn’t the usual place, but I felt it was the best place to put it. 

Where I lived, addiction is a big issue. I lived in Vancouver (Canada) for a large portion of my life, but recently moved to Alberta, and I still talk to my old friends who live in Vancouver.

The thing is. Addiction is becoming a bigger and bigger issue in Vancouver. 

I recently found out via my childhood best friend, M, that a friend of ours, E, had died of a cocaine overdose. 

Her death has kinda shocked me and hit a bit hard. I don’t remember a lot about her, but like, the fact someone I knew just...sorta ceases to ‘exist’ now has kinda made me feel some kinda way. 

The thing that really fucked me up though is thinking how much addiction has just. Fucked me up in general. 

E died of a cocaine overdose. Me and M’s friend, N, is currently an addict and has been on and off of being homeless and an addict since 2015. The drugs turned her into a not great person... 

My brother is a recovering meth addict. My mom did meth when I was a kid too. 

And while talking to M about E, I found out M still does coke and molly. 

I myself am a step away from being an addict. I’m already addicted to a few less important things (smoker, a few other things), and I’m apparently a half step away from becoming an alcoholic. 

I don’t really know how to cope with this or what to do about it, I’m only 20, I shouldn’t be in a situation of planning what to do if M overdoses. I shouldn’t have a vivid memory of a kid (under 15) who died of overdose outside of my house and the fact my brother did CPR on her and that maybe if I had looked out my window and saw her on the ground before my brother got home, I could have helped. 

I just needed somewhere to get this off my mind. I’ve been mauling over it ever since I found out about E. I can’t help but stress myself out over what’d happen if N or M overdosed. I can’t help but stress about where I’m going to go in the future and if I’m going to end up turning to drugs as well. It sure as hell is tempting and it’s not like I haven’t tried. Though the drugs I’m in preference too are a lot lighter than coke and meth (I got a preference to things like benzos) And of course, some good ol alcohol. 

Idk man, it’s just fucked up, one friends already died, I’m just waiting for the rest to follow. 

Sorry if this isn’t appropriate for this sub. Not sure where to post it. Almost posted it to r/depression but realized it might fit this one better. If someone had a better idea where this could go I got no problems deleting it and reposting it to the other sub.

“I AM METH”

(This was written by a young Indian girl who was in jail for drug charges, and was addicted to meth. She wrote this while in jail. As you will soon read, she fully grasped the horrors of the drug, as she tells in this simple, yet profound poem. She was released from jail, but, true to her story, the drug owned her. They found her dead not long after, with the needle still in her arm.)

Please keep praying for our Children, Teens, Young adults. Understand, this thing is worse than any of us realize …

I destroy homes, I tear families apart,
I take your children, and that’s just the start.

I’m more costly than diamonds, more precious than gold,
The sorrow I bring is a sight to behold.

If you need me, remember I’m easily found,
I live all around you – in schools and in town

I live with the rich, I live with the poor,
I live down the street, and maybe next door.

I’m made in a lab, but not like you think,
I can be made under the kitchen sink.

In your child’s closet, and even in the woods,
If this scares you to death, well it certainly should.

I have many names, but there’s one you know best,
I’m sure you’ve heard of me, my name is crystal meth.

My power is awesome, try me you’ll see,
But if you do, you may never break free.

Just try me once and I might let you go,
But try me twice, and I’ll own your soul.

When I possess you, you’ll steal and you’ll lie,
You do what you have to — just to get high.

The crimes you’ll commit for my narcotic charms
Will be worth the pleasure you’ll feel in your arms.

You’ll lie to your mother, you’ll steal from your dad,
When you see their tears, you should feel sad.

But you’ll forget your morals and how you were raised,
I’ll be your conscience, I’ll teach you my ways.

I take kids from parents, and parents from kids,
I turn people from God, and separate friends.

I’ll take everything from you, your looks and your pride,
I’ll be with you always — right by your side.

You’ll give up everything – your family, your home,
Your friends, your money, then you’ll be alone.

I’ll take and take, till you have nothing more to give,
When I’m finished with you, you’ll be lucky to live.

If you try me be warned – this is no game,
If given the chance, I’ll drive you insane.

I’ll ravish your body, I’ll control your mind,
I’ll own you completely, your soul will be mine.

The nightmares I’ll give you while lying in bed,
The voices you’ll hear, from inside your head.

The sweats, the shakes, the visions you’ll see,
I want you to know, these are all gifts from me.

But then it’s too late, and you’ll know in your heart,
That you are mine, and we shall not part.

You’ll regret that you tried me, they always do,
But you came to me, not I to you.

You knew this would happen, many times you were told,
But you challenged my power, and chose to be bold.

You could have said no, and just walked away,
If you could live that day over, now what would you say?

I’ll be your master, you will be my slave,
I’ll even go with you, when you go to your grave.

Now that you have met me, what will you do?
Will you try me or not? It’s all up to you.

I can bring you more misery than words can tell,
Come take my hand, let me lead you to hell.",665,0.0,0,0.0

1093,addiction,2020/03/08,"The big challenge is on again Been coasting through giving up my DOC until now. Generally I'm ok, with occasional relapse which sets me back mentally and physically. It's been a good run recently. Normally everytime I would clear my house of all the things related to it, I'd immediately go on a bender/relapse. Rebuy all the neccessary devices, just to throw it away again.  This time I just let it sit hidden in my house and ignored that it was there. I was relatively fine. Thought I was strong enough after all long solid run, so I got rid of everything and no craving just kept in with my life. It felt like I'd turned a corner, but now a few days later I'm having the kind of craving that I've never beat before. I'm feeling the physical tension, mental agitation, absent mindedness, excitement I would feel before I used. I'm visualizing picking up cash and buying all the needed things again. A part of my brain is setting up the plan to use in case it can catch the other part of my brain off guard. Im keeping busy. I dont normally work out today, but dressed n ready about to head out. Going to take a quick shower after instead of my normal long bath today and back to busy. If it persists going to take to next level, a meeting tonight or if not possible some addiction reading and go to group meditation at 7am tomorrow. Just about as loud as the sneaky plan making, I'm hearing myself say that I will only recover if I dont do it, add more support. I can't put this part of my life behind me unless I abstain.

1094,addiction,2020/03/08,"I need help. Hey everyone. 

I wasn't quite sure where to post this, but I need to get all of this off my chest and could really use some advice/feedback on my situation.

A little background information about me, I am a 24 y/o guy currently in treatment for opioid addiction. I have also dabbled heavily in taking basically every drug you could think of. I started out maintenance treatment taking Suboxone about three years ago and ultimately switched to Methadone maintenance about a year and a half ago. I take 105mg of methadone daily. 
I received a call from my clinic and my grant (which pays for my treatment) is going to end the on May 31st. So obviously this is really stressing me out. I currently stay in a transitional housing environment and volunteer on a daily basis to keep a bed here. I can't go out and work a day job because I have to be here ""volunteering"" or I'd basically be to the point of sleeping outdoors.
What I am about to say may sound odd, I haven't told anyone about this aside from two of my close friends. I am addicted to Benadryl. For the past year I have augmented my methadone dose with 350mg + diphenhydramine daily. I do this because I believe I'm not at a dose which is properly maintaining me and my doctor at the clinic is very hesitant to go above 100mg in ANY of the patients.

More recently, the past couple months I have been regularly taking Xanax and Etizolam. I have started craving them pretty intensely. I do have panic disorder/generalized anxiety, I've dealt with it for as long as I can remember... and have been prescribed benzos in the past, and have definitely acquired an extreme liking for them. 

Today, I've probably taken upwards of 5,000mg + of gabapentin and I feel the urge to keep eating them. I am so sick of my situation and I just want out. I can't do this anymore.

1098,addiction,2020/03/08,"How to get better. Hi! I’m a 16F who needs some good advice.
My life story in a reddit post... 
(My apologies bc it’s so long!!)

Divorced parents at 2 y/o, never got to see my dad, private school ➡️ public school, never played sports, no extracurricular activities, had a hard time transitioning into different schooling.

Made friends with A LOT of people. Yet, I still felt like I wasn’t meant to be friends with anyone. Everyone in my city is just lame and toxic. But I did because I’m “social”. 

Got into drugs at 13... turned out so bad. 
Addicted to nicotine!! 
Started going to high school, got diagnosed with mental illnesses, and my life spiraled down :/ was forced to stop taking my meds by mom, tried acid and had a BAD TRIP, stopped going to school completely, truants daily, stopped talking to all of my friends and household, never left my room, used adderall to be skinny, had a sleeping disorder resulted from adderall, continued my problems with narcotics and alcohol frequently, if accessible. 
Moving on, I realized I had a huge support system who just wanted me to get better. A part of me DOES want to change so much. 

So, after failing my whole freshman year, I decided to retake all my classes online over the summer. I ended with straight A’s, it was fairly easy. 
At this point, my drug use was pretty much non existent. Except nicotine of course. Other than that maybe here and there, with friends, but I’m not the one to party and drink with other people from my school...
I got back into school, slowly started talking to people, but I didn’t stick around with a certain person for too long. 
I have trust issues, especially with people who don’t have the best intentions. 
Everything was all good, until I started slipping.

I started spending all my money on any type of high (up to $100 daily) or searched around for anything that I could use (Prescription Pills) Yes that sounds just as bad as you think. 
To me using stuff keeps me grounded. I feel like I don’t have to be anxious about everything surrounding my life. Many people around me are just disappointed in me. It’s hard to take the action to quit.

Right now, I’m on adderall and wax (thc).
I’ve been using addy daily for 2 weeks. Missed a lot of school.. Fucked up my sleep schedule again! Backed up on school work with all C’s (which isn’t too bad and can easily turn around~according to my school counselor)

I feel like I’m slipping to the same person as last year. 
My life is pretty boring but I’m always doing something dumb. Now my memory is so messed up, I can’t have proper conversations with people, can’t concentrate, and I have a constant need of any high. 
I guess these are the consequences everyone is talking about.
Because of this, I’ve been wanting to try independent study for the last semester of this year. I told my counselor I’m trying to stay away from getting drugs at school. She said I could only do that if I show proof of getting into addiction treatment..Which I think is a good thing. 
Then she told me I have to consistently go and fix my attendance and then they’ll think about it... Such a long process.

I’ve discussed with my mom about rehab but I always told her I didn’t want to. And she thinks I’ll relapsed and I agree. I feel bad because she just has to watch me destroy my body. 

I don’t think I’m looking forward to anything in life. 
I want to find something I’m interested in, do good in school, and actually live a good life. 
I guess the treatment is a good start.. How do I find REAL friends that are supportive, and won’t mock my addictions...

1100,addiction,2020/03/08,"Am I an 'addict'? Am I just crazy? [CW: mentions of cutting, self-destructive behaviour]

This post might be a mess and may not even belong here. I don't know. I don't. 

Context first, because I dont know anyone who's like me and feel this situation needs an Explanation. It's super long, sorry,,, **tl;dr at the end**.

I've had a history of self-destructive behaviour since I was born, but for most of my young childhood I didnt dwell on it, and it may not be relevant here. I'll discuss it if asked, but for now I'll skip it.

As a teenager, I started cutting. I was told it gave people 'relief' or an 'outlet', and it Did Not do that for me. But, even without it being a coping thing, I seemed to have this *drive*, somehow, something that made me want to keep going, made me want to keep doing it. I didnt think about other people, or other things with my cutting, it was only me and this Drive. 

People fretting over me and my annoyance at being confronted/pitied caused me to do it very little or go long periods without, but my desire was always there. I didnt think too deep about it, because to me, it was Natural. It just felt Right. It wasnt for attention (god, please, no), and it wasnt for 'coping' or whatever. The only relief cutting gave me was...... relieving my desire to cut. 

Then, about a year ago, a friend found out about it, and he compared my cutting to a ""toxic relationship"", personified my cutting as an abusive lover I couldn't let go of.

And somehow, something shifted in me after that. My cutting/urges became sort of personified in my mind, an entity. I began to see my relationship with cutting/self-harm almost as an intense, passionate romance, feeling that in a way, I was ""in love"" with it. And slowly, other self-destructive behaviour I had engaged in on and off (disordered eating, reckless sex, ect) went from being urges that I didn't really think about, into almost a..... calling. I fantasize heavily about engaging in these things, about 'giving in' and letting them consume me, and just the thought leaves me feeling almost euphoric.

I watched some videos by a recovering addict a while back, and he stated that he felt that there was a 'devil' inside him, that drugs had awoken some part of him that fed on his urges and was incredibly, painfully alluring. That he was horrified by it, and that he couldnt resist ""loving"" it. This resonated with me, a lot. Even as I feel far more enamoured than 'horrified', I recognize how bizarre and disturbing my euphoric self-destruction is to other people, and I....... hestiate, sometimes.

So with the explanation out of the way......

1. I think people would say I'm 'addicted' to cutting/self-harm. But I don't think I can be?? Addiction is when someone uses behaviours/substances in order to cope with life issues/trauma/ect, and then become reliant on it and can't stop. But I don't do these things to cope with negative emotions.....

2. More importantly to the ""I can't be addicted"" thing, is that I can stop however long I want, whenever. I can go months, years, without cutting/ect, with little struggle, just to avoid conflict in my life. People who are actually addicted can't just Stop, and they struggle immensely, and there will be times where they cant resist. I can, and i could indefinitely. So clearly I can't be addicted.

3. I know how much I SOUND like an addict in some ways, and how much I relate to certain things about addiction. But, considering 1 and 2, I worry that I'm an awful person for think I relate......... it feels like I'm being disrespectful. Am I? I know how much addicts struggle, I don't want to be disrespectful about that.......

4. And last, I guess I just want thoughts. I dont know what I would even do if I were 'addicted'. Or what it even means for me either way. I dont know what Im supposed to think of my situation. I know what I FEEL, but sometimes I...... pause for a moment, and have a feeling of ""what's happening to me?? something is wrong here, right....?"", and it eats at me a little. 

I don't know. I dont think I've ever heard of anyone like me. Any thoughts? Im sorry for how long this was,,

**TL;DR - I'm utterly 'infatuated' with cutting and self-destructive behaviour. I don't 'depend' on it for coping or anything, I can (and do) stop for long periods of time with minimal effort. But, I relate heavily to a lot of addicts' experiences/feelings/thought patterns/ect, and many would say I sound like an addict. Am I possibly an 'addict'......? Or am I just some crazy weirdo? Thoughts??**",864,0.0,0,0.0
1101,addiction,2020/03/08,It’s a rough night (adderall) So short story I was on prescribed adderall from first grade until senior year of high school when I stopped cold turkey. I had some issues with adderall affecting my self-image and some unhealthy dependency. I was and am lucky enough to have come up with coping skills to function and be fairly successful in schooling and life. But every once in a while I get a craving for it to make my life easier. And tonight I was watching a show where a character takes an adderall that looked exactly like mine and my mouth started watering and all I wanted was one pill so I could do my homework without struggling. I’m a little freaked by how strong the craving was and I just really want some encouragement. No one really knows about this struggle. Hope this post is okay.,150,0.0,0,0.0

1103,addiction,2020/03/08,"I cant do this anymore For the millionth time I sit here having relapsed. I know how this goes: ill lay awake all night restless with regret and self hate. Realizing all the relationships Ive destroyed and all the ones I can't have because of the way I am. Tomorrow Ill wake up feeling even worse; severely hungover and wired, steeped in paranoia, anxiety, and an indescribably intense sense of depression. I'll regret every self destructive and impulsive decision I made the night before when I was high and intoxicated, wondering who that person was, because it wasnt me.

Then, Ill tell myself that in a couple days the comedown will be gone and I'll be semi-functional again, and it'll be okay. I just have to make it there. And then I'll never do this stuff again, and I'll get better. But at that point I'll also be intensely craving another fix and it'll be all I can think about, and I'll have totally forgotten about the way I'm feeling right now. 

The only thing I'll know at that point is how horrible the withdrawal is: the feeling of total emptiness, the inability to feel any pleasure whatsoever. The shaking, the paranoia, the aches, the weakness. The constant fear of living life without my drug. The lack of motivation to even have a conversation with another human being. The only thing I'll want to do is sleep, and escape life.

The worst thing about addiction, is that most of the time (except for rare ones like this), I cant even be sad about what Ive done. I dont regret it, I dont cry over it, I dont apologize for it. I wont desire a better life, or friends, or any sort of relationships. Because I can't. Even though I wish I had those desires and feelings, very soon my brain will tell me I dont need those things, and theres only one thing I need. And then I'll be that other person again.

I’ve played video games since I was a child with friends and alone. It used to be a casual thing, all my friends played halo and we had video game birthday parties and hang-outs. It would be mixed in with outdoor activities and school. I had a really good friend group up until middle school where we all separated but I stayed close friends with one of them. 

Middle school was great it was the same thing having fun playing games and I made another friend group. Then high school hit.

I won’t go into details about freshman and sophomore year because it was all-around fine same friend group and I was happy. Around Junior year was where things started going downhill. My friends and I started smoking weed everyday and we become a group that smokes and tries psychedelics. Now that I’m writing this part everything about that year seems kind of blurry. I remember that I progressively become more paranoid and anxious while high and at some point I started becoming anxious and paranoid while sober. This is was where my depression started. I started to lose most of the friends I’ve become acquainted with in high school and I was entering a dark hole of anxiety and panic attacks. I would feel like I was dying and the world was staring at me watching me die and not doing anything but stare. It was the fucking worst and it just made me more and more anxious and depressed every single day. It didn’t stop and this is where video games started to come in to play. Because of my anxiety I couldn’t step outside of my room. I was losing myself and I wasn’t able to stop it. I started playing video games non-stop as means to silence my brain and the terrible thoughts it made. It worked really well. It become the only thing in my life that wasn’t painful. (Holy shit this extremely depressing I’m sorry).

Video games became my addiction... it’s been 3 years since junior year. I have don’t absolutely nothing I’ve lost everyone around except for my mom my sister and a friend who is becoming more and more distant to my pathetic existence.

The reason I’m writing this is because to is the first time in 3 fucking years that I’ve made the decision on my own to stop. I hiked for the first time in years and when I got back into my car it was the best I’ve ever felt in I don’t know how long.

1119,addiction,2020/03/10,"Should I be concerned? (Vyvanse) I (21M) was diagnosed with ADHD a few years back, after whole childhood of living with untreated attention problems. I have been prescribed several different stimulant meds since 2018 including Adderall, Evekeo, Concerta, and now Vyvanse 50mg. The thing is, I've been taking it every day and noticing that it has been working less than I would like as time goes on. I find myself thinking and doing concerning things. For example, there were a couple days that I took 2 of the 50mg capsules instead of 1, usually resulting in not a better focus but rather a manic episode of some sort. I don't know why I still have urges to take more than I'm supposed to since I know logically that more will not help me complete tasks such as studying and whatnot. I feel like I can't think logically and my impulsivity is just as bad, if not worse than it was untreated. Is it possible that I never had ADHD in the first place? I've suspected that I may have it since I found out about it in middle school. Also, the 3 psychiatrists I've been to all agree that I indeed have it and should be on stimulants. (I've been completely honest about my symptoms every time). 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been worried since before I was diagnosed that I would probably turn out to be addicted to this stuff if I've taken it long enough, and whoop-de-fuckin-doo here I am, sometimes impulsively taking 100mg of Vyvanse in a day, tossing and turning all night instead of sleeping.

&amp;#x200B;

So right now, I'm a few days away from spring break of senior year, midterm on Friday, and I'm stuck between continuing to take more for the next few days and try to study, since I will absolutely not take any during spring break, hopefully that will reset my tolerance and I'll be able to take it as a normal medication from there on out...... Or taking it as prescribed, which still gives me urges to indulge in whatever dopamine available since my tolerance is messed up, which also means I won't be able to concentrate on anything...... Or just give up this semester since I just recently came back from a mental hospital after a month of being absent from the semester, lying about my addiction in order to return. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm gaining tolerance to my ADHD medication (Vyvanse) and idk if I should keep increasing the dose to pass my midterm this week, depending on Spring Break next week to normalize my tolerance, or just give up this semester entirely and come clean for a few months, which also means I won't be able to graduate for another year.",481,0.0,0,0.0

Until now, I've managed to fill my time with sober social stuff, gym and work, but agonizingly I have had to take some annual leave and will be off from work Friday and Monday plus the weekend with no friends available at short notice. This week has been the most anxiety provoking in my sobriety as I had an internal job interview and my self-esteem still sucks so I can't really assess how it went. Getting the train back from the interview I passed several pubs plus there was alcohol on the train and I have no idea how I'm going to cope with doing nothing for 4 days, especially if I don't hear back from work.  


The interview is incredibly important as the new role would make me properly secure at work and my current one could possibly be cut from the budget.

It has been over a year since my rehab and my 6 months in sober living, I had a relapse about 6 months ago but have been clean since

I have had jobs off and on, but I can't keep any work since my addiction

I live with my partner who is taking care of everything money-wise, I try to keep the place picked up in return, but fall short of that too

There are many reasons I can't keep a job I think, I have severe anxiety and minor depression. I also have no insurance for therapy/psychiatry and there are not many community health centers in my area. 

I am afraid of working again because every time in the past when I have a decent amount of money, I relapse

I am afraid of working because I don't want to fail AGAIN, it seems I stay clean with just staying at home doing nothing, but I am doing nothing with my life. I feel horrible about it every day.

I guess I'm asking for advice/help... What motivates you? I want to do better for myself and my partner. It seems every time things get good I fuck up again, so I don't do anything I guess.

1123,addiction,2020/03/10,"The Story Of Doug Felone (Drug Felon) Doug is an average guy who worked hard to get through school and has always held a solid earning job. He is a friendly guy with a lot of friends. He’s mild tempered and mild mannered. He’s never caused harm to another being, abides by the basic laws of society and had a perfectly clean record.

One day Doug is out riding his bicycle and gets struck by a car. He gets treated at the hospital and for his recovery is given pain meds. One day he runs out of his pain meds; he starts vomiting, has diarrhea and more pain than he could ever imagine. The doctor won’t prescribe more meds and his insurance refuses to cover the $900 a day for a basic rehab facility. All he wants to do is alleviate the anguish until he can figure out what to do in order to get his life back on track, so he illegally acquires some pills from a friend of a friend. Unbeknownst to him this person is under surveillance.

A few days later the police show up at his house to inform him that they have him on film purchasing drugs from a known dealer. Doug is booked into county jail where he is surrounded by real criminals, until he is able to make bail. A year of court proceedings ensue until the prosecutor has a “sweet” deal to offer him; accept a felony charge, four months in jail and three years of probation or he could take a gamble by going to trial and risk up to six years in prison. Out of fear Doug accepts the deal, Doug Felone is now a drug felon.

Upon his release from jail, he is now clean and starting life over again. He goes out to apply for jobs but ends up getting turned down at every place he applies due to his felony record. His years and money spent in college are now worthless, yet he still owes tens of thousands in student loan debt. In addition to that it is also difficult for him to find a decent place to live, he is finding that most leasing agencies won’t rent to felons, regardless of having good credit and an eviction-free record. Many of his friends no longer want to associate with him, not because his was an addict for a brief time, but because he is now considered a criminal. Everything he has worked for in his life has now gone to waste. Doug is now a second rate citizen who can no longer contribute to society in ways he was once able to.

Doug feels as though he is left with only two options. First option is to work a menial, low paying job in which he will never get caught up in life and will never be financially stable again. The second option appears to be more lucrative, however it may involve scamming others, selling drugs or robbery.

There is a reason the crime recidivism rate is much higher for a felon as compared to someone with a misdemeanor or someone who is given the option of court ordered rehab. It may be easy to judge someone based on the fact they are or once were an addict, however it’s not always that black and white. Some others grow up in a household where addiction is rampant and it is all they know. Regardless of how they became an addict, do they deserve the right to have a fair chance at life, or should they forever be labeled a felon and be treated as such? What option would YOU take if you were in Doug’s shoes?

1128,addiction,2020/03/10,"addiction ruins lives in ways people don’t even think. i was fucked up on anything i could be for months straight. or on a comedown or hungover. for months straight. didn’t realise how bad it was, nobody could get through to me and a lot of people were similar enough they didn’t try. in the state i was in i was blind and numb to everything, feeling things i didn’t feel, doing bad things i didn’t see as bad. 
i lost a lot of long term friends during this period and all of the respect i had from them. my relationship with my family fell to pieces- and they still don’t know the extent of the problem. they don’t even know i touched hard drugs- all they knew was a bit of alcohol and weed here and there. 
addiction is a weird mental health issue (calling it a mental health issue cause that’s what it is).
a lot of people don’t see it how it is and as much as there’s ‘narciccists and borderlines are the most hated!!’ i disagree. addicts are among the most hated and people don’t even realise. i used to hate addicts without even realising until i went through it myself. 
of course we do selfish things. i brought people down the hole with me, i encouraged other people into this shit, glorified it, did extremely fucked up shit while fucked up, i was selfish and deluded and angry and lost. i behaved in a way that was impossible to not hate, i told people who were clearly right they were wrong, acted out constantly, even scammed people i cared about for price and sold them the same drugs that ruined me at all, and  the most crazy thing is i didn’t even realise how hated i was- had a weird sense of pride (probably from the coke n booze). thought i was cooler and had more friends and whatever than i did- and i didn’t even believe i was liked in the slightest. 
addiction makes people selfish and cold and behave crazy. i understand now- when you see addicts walking the streets talking to themselves, a lot of the time they won’t even realise the extent or their problem. won’t even realise how fried their brain is. won’t see how they’ve been fucked up for months or years, somehow. 
i lost more people than i can count when i was an addict. of course i’m hurt by the people that left me and grateful for the people that stuck by me, for some reason. 
but also feel guilty and don’t understand why. to be honest, i’d probably have left me before i understood me. 
now i see the addicts in my family and i see various addicts and i’m no longer scared and full of hatred- i’m just sad for them. they’re lost and hated and one thing i learnt from being an addict is SO many people give up on you, and i’m sure enough people gave up on them that it’s almost understandable why they only rely on drugs now. 
afterall, heroin will always be around when your girlfriend breaks your heart.. heroin won’t leave you, you have to leave heroin. 
i’m sorry this is preachy and ranty and doesn’t come to much of a conclusion. i just want people to see the other side and have more sympathy. see addiction as a mental illness that needs treating, not give up on their addicted friends and family like my family did to me and the other addicts in my family who i am now sad about how they’re shunned and a lot more understanding, and not make excuses for addicts bad behaviour, but understand just how far the impact of being really fucking high can make a person go. sober and well me isn’t drunk and high me. sober me isn’t a bad person. high and drunk me is a bad person- but also a lost person who needed more people to stay. i definitely want to raise awareness for addiction in the future, i mean i feel fairly purposeless now and that would give me some sort of purpose.. not enough people are speaking out. 
i guess a lot either die to their addiction or speak out during it or have nobody to listen. but we need awareness and less hatred. less stigma. more friends and family.

Hi , 

I’m a long time Reddit reader, first time reddit poster so forgive me if I posted this in the wrong community. 

Basically, I’m addicted to cocaine and I’m ready to quit. I have tried a handful of times in the past, Gave it up for a few weeks and then found a way to convince myself to do it. 

I never used to have an addictive personality, I have tried other drugs (molly, weed, lsd etc) and was able to control any impulse to use keeping it to limited occasions, however with cocaine I always find a way to convince myself to do it, thinking it’ll be different or something.  

I’ve been doing it for about two years now, it started off as a way to self medicate and deal with my depression however Ive realized that it is not the way to deal with this and have accepted that I am addicted. I’ve overdosed, had it ruin my relationships with my mom and boyfriend, dropped out of school, and  pretty much just ruined any motivation I had to do shit with my life. 

I’m on track to getting my life together finally now. I have a new job that pays well, and got accepted to go back to school next semester. I really want to continue on this good path and don’t want to let this addiction ruin my life.

Rehab unfortunately does not work for me. I know that is the preferred method. I am really forced to do this on my own. None of my friends or any one close to me share this issue.

1140,addiction,2020/03/11,"I'm running on empty and I don't know what to think anymore! TL:DR - My brother has been getting drunk and high for most of my life.  This week he almost died, decided to get sober, and I haven't been able to process it yet. 

First off, sorry for the LONG ASS post.  But this has been weighing on me and it just came out like a load of verbal vomit. 

The last two weeks have been pretty monumentally hell-ish for me, and truly, I just want to stop doing everything and sleep for the next month. Back Story: I have BPD. My brother has been relatively recently diagnosed with Bi-Polar. He's also an alcoholic. He's two years older than me and was always the 'bad kid' growing up. This honestly fed into my BPD because all I wanted to do was be perfect so our parents would notice me and give me the love and attention I desired. Unfortunately, they were too busy disciplining him and (as I've learned this week) convincing him to keep secrets from me for the past 20 years. The parents didn't want me to be conflicted or make the same choices he was making so they kept everything a secret. This includes their discretions as well as his.  

Now my brother and I weren't really close, but we had a lot of overlap when it came to our friends so we would end up at similar hang outs on the weekends. I knew he drank. I knew he smoked. I knew he got high. I'd be blind not to. I just didn't know EVERYTHING. 

Throughout the years, I've seen him make poor decisions for himself, but I would let him do it, because I wanted him to know he could trust me when he felt he couldn't trust our parents. He would wreck cars and I knew he was probably drinking, but he would tell our parents that it was some other reason. He's also gotten a couple of DUIs which caused him to also lose his license for quite some time. 

Fast forward to about 4 years ago, he really starting to seem like he was getting his life on the right track. He was a proud father, had a job he'd been working to get for years, and in a happy relationship. He also got his license back. But then he starting stealing our vehicles. He would go out after we all went to bed and take our keys and go out and try to come back before we woke up. We even found him in the back of a sex shop one time. It then started to escalate. He totaled my parents' car. He was only about two blocks from our house when he drunkenly hit a parked car. Our neighbor, who is a local police officer, came out and arrested him as he was trying to leave a note on the car apologizing. 

He served a week in jail, had to take a anti-drinking seminar, and lost his license again. He then began going to AA. This didn't really work out for him, because he's a conflicted atheist (in the sense that he not only doesn't believe in a God. He doesn't believe in anything. So some steps seem implausible for him.) 

He was good for a few months, got a new job, got on medication. Then something would trigger him and he would start stealing our cars again . \*\*Please note that we did hide our car keys at night. Mine were on my night stand and my parents were in their room on the dresser.\*\* We also learned this week that in addition to drinking again, he also started using meth ‘recreationally’. 

The next accident happened the following winter when I woke up to find that my car was parked in the street, missing its bumper, and my parents' (now new) car was missing. He came home and claimed that he just pulled it out into the street and didn't take it anywhere. It must have been a hit-and-run, except that the damage was facing the curb, NOT the street. I was livid and, obviously, made him pay the deductible to have my car fixed. Even if his BS story was true, if he wouldn't have moved it, it wouldn't have gotten 'hit'. 

Same cycle happened again and again, with a growing number of wrecked cars. Each time he seemed to hit his lowest low and promise to change but never did. It mostly happened if we forgot to take our keys with us at night. It was as if it was permission to him to take them. 

It all came to a head two weeks ago. He snuck into my parents’ room and took their keys from the dresser. He took the car out. And got drunk. And got high. And got into an accident. But this time, he fled the scene. The car was totaled again. Unfortunately for my parents, the insurance was not covering anything, because they made my dad sign a document stating that my brother was explicitly excluded from coverage and they wouldn’t have to pay if he got into an accident and wrecked it. Even if my parents reported it stolen. 

My brother was missing for four days until we get a call from him – in the hospital. He was bitten by a dog and the bite got infected. The first day I went to visit him in the hospital, I yelled at him. I was so mad at what idiotic decisions he had been making, and that he felt he couldn’t come to me. I would always tell him that he could come to me. I felt betrayed. My parents stayed quiet as they were still in shock from the week’s events. My brother finally started being honest with us and with himself. He admitted to all the lying and drugs that he’s been using. He admitted that it was finally time he got professional help, and I’m (skeptically) hopeful that he means it. 

While in the hospital, we cleaned out his room of all the contraband and triggers that we found and from places he told us. It was refreshing that he was finally sober and wanting to be.

The hardest part is that he’s all sunshine and rainbows and optimism now. My parents still look like their broken – like they failed. They knew that I’ve been dealing with a lot of abandonment issues due to my Borderline, but they never thought that it had gotten to this point with my brother. 

I’ve been doing my best to be the rock and hold down the fort, but I keep telling them to go to therapy. That they need to find a healthy unbiased outlet that will give them tools to help work through these emotions and deal with them in the right way. They won’t, or at least my dad keeps deflecting, while my mom just says nothing and tries not to cry. 

I really don’t know what more I can do. I mean, nothing. It’s all on them. It’s their choice, but I don’t want to make them feel guilty for leaning on me when I don’t think I’m strong enough to help them through. I honestly still haven’t been able to fully work through it. My brother is being radically honest and sees me as his champion because I’ve fought for him to get sober since the beginning, and my parents have just shut down. 

I wish I could just be honest with everyone, but just like when I was a kid, I choose to make myself invisible instead of possibly inconveniencing them with what I need (emotionally). Especially when they’re going through so much. 

I don’t expect advice. I just needed to get this out. My brother has his CD eval today and then court on Tuesday from his last DUI arrest, where he may get arrested again for the hit and run – since he still has that warrant out.",1387,1.0,2,0.0014419610670511895

In January to March of 2016, I was raped multiple times by a man who I trusted very deeply. It happened multiple times and I fell into a very dark place.

1148,addiction,2020/03/11,"I’m thinking about rehab....again I’ve been once for benzos. It was mostly smooth sailing off of it, but I was young, tapered off of it, and went to some cushy place in Florida. I’m 25 now, jobless, depressed, on Medicaid, and feeding/cleaning house for my grandparents and disabled mother. I’m drinking every night but I don’t think they know the extent of it. My s/o partakes but has much greater self-control than I do and I feel like he’d be okay if I left again, maybe it’d even be a wake-up call for him.   

Thing is- I don’t want to tell anyone I’m going until I’ve gone. I know he’d try to talk me out of it, suggest cutting back like we’ve tried before. I’m just so tired of being tired. My stomach hurts. My head hurts. I have diarrhea almost every morning. It all just fucking sucks. I want to rip it off like a band aid.   

One of the people I trust most just stopped drinking without rehab or inpatient intervention and I respect the fuck out of her for it, but I don’t think I realistically could do that myself. Honestly if I were going to tell anyone about this it would be her, but she’s kind of who got me into this mess to begin with (in a way.)   
 
I don’t want to hurt anyone by leaving abruptly, but that’s how I did it the first time. I decided the night before, they set me up, and I left the next morning. I was 18 and it was the first time I’d ever flown alone. My mom refused to take me so I had to have a friend of a friend drive me to the airport.

So I recently broke up with my boyfriend who had three years sober until he relapsed back in August. I moved far away to go to school and it got really bad. I broke up with him about a month ago. We still kept in contact and he called me basically telling me that he took a lot of GHB trying to OD. I called his mom and she called paramedics. 

He was going to treatment when we found out his best friend died of an OD. This was last Monday. 

I hadn’t had any contact with anyone and thought things must have been ok since I hadn’t heard from anyone. 

Today I found out our really good friend died in a motorcycle accident. I called his mom to tell her. And then she tells me that my bf was not ok and he took something but it turned out to be something else and he was in the hospital unconscious and woke up Sunday and has been on a 24/7 watch. She said that no one thought he was going to make it and that everyone was coming in to say goodbye. 

I’m just grieving the loss of my two friends. And scared and worried for my bf. I’m also very upset that no one told me about his state and feel like I deserved to know. She said that they thought it was better if we weren’t in contact. I don’t know what’s right and what’s wrong and it’s all confusing and I just don’t know how to feel.",317,0.0,0,0.0

1153,addiction,2020/03/12,"So I've almost ruined my life a thousand times in the last 41 years. I got drunk for the first time when I was 14. From that night on, I knew I could feel different. I could actually have feelings that weren't bad, negative, anxious. I had found the secret to life. The actual ability to control and change your fucking feelings. Alcohol definitely opened the door of curiosity of other substances. And I thought illegal drugs must be illegal because they feel so good. I couldn't wait to try anything and everything.
  So maybe a year later I had the opportunity to smoke pot. Bought a joint off of a kid on the school bus. Smoked it at my parents house and mowed the yard. I now understood that illegal drugs were fucking awesome. I never looked back. When I had a chance to try something new, I jumped on it.
Throughout the years cocaine, MDMA weed, Xanax, pills whatever. I never really cared for opiates or pain pills. Just not my cup of tea.
  So eventually I got into selling cocaine. And if you have ever sold coke, you already know. Cocaine sells itself. Easiest fucking money I've ever made. I still have bad financial habits from  my attitudes on money that I gained while selling cocaine. Money is free right? 
  Well, cocaine and that lifestyle never lasts forever. I got an 8 year sentence for Possession for resale. Did 5 and a half years in the state penitentiary system. It was actually good for me. I never wanted to go back to that place so I grew up in there. It's been 10 years since I got out and I didn't. So I never sold drugs again, I would partake in alcohol and marijuana, cocaine whenever it was around once a year maybe. But the prices for a gram now verses when I sold it, I couldn't but coke on principle. $100 a gram? Fuck you. I got ounces for $800 when I was in the game.
  So around 3 years ago, was hanging out with a friend and they said they had a few lines. Awesome! So she cracked out these tiny little lines and I didn't have the heart to tell her what a cheap fuck she was, but whatever its free. I snorted one and it burned like fuck. It had been a year or two since I had put anything up my nose so I didn't think anything of it. I got zoned into my phone watching porn, because let's be honest, stimulants and sex go together like peanut butter and jelly. I wasn't paying much attention to the time but I felt good as fuck. So my mouth all the sudden was extremely dry. I got up to get some water and my legs were stiff. What the fuck is going on? I looked at the time, I had been sitting there for 3 hours and I was still fucking going hard. I asked my friend for another line because surely it's about to wear off. She gave me a pill cracker with a little bit of powder in it. I asked her if I could cut the lines out she agreed. Well, she wasn't looking very hard and I cut out 4 real lines. One way bigger than the others. I did it real quick and told her to come and get it. She said, ""Those are kind of big."" And then she looked in the pill grinder and was like, ""WHAT THE FUCK? Where did it all go?"" I mean, I've never let anyone have access to the shit I was sharing. She should have been smarter. I told her may have taken liberties. She says, ""You know that's not cocaine right?"" I said, ""Well what the fuck is it?"" ""That's methamphetamine you dumb fuck."" I immediately asked if she could get more. New drug? Let's do it. She says sure, I give her 100 bucks and she's off. She comes back around a half hour later with my new drug and I crack outs some old school cocaine train tracks. I have done a shit load of cocaine and that all I had to go on. She asked me, are you sure? Fuck yeah I'm sure. 

####4 DAYS LATER

  Im finally able to go to sleep. So I did that for a few weekends until my friend went to jail and I didn't see her or methamphetamine again for 2 years. 

####2 YEARS LATER

  The young wanna be gangster that lives across the street come over to ask about something and I'm smoking a bowl of pot. I ask if he wants to hit it and he does. After we get high he tells me he has Ice to sale. Well ok. That was as easy. I got a gram December 31rst. Though I'd have some fun for the weekend.

####5 MONTHS LATER

WTF just happened. How did 5 months go by in 2 weeks? My work was suffering every relationship I had was suffering and I was an wreck of a human beings emotionally. I had some sort of moment of clarity and made a decision to quit. I never looked back. It was actually pretty easy.

####January 2020

Guy I work with tells me he's got ice. I jumped on it. I forgot about the bad times. I just remembered quiting fairly easy. 

  Well just like the last time almost 2 months went by in a heartbeat. I've been seeing a girl since September and we've drank and smoked a little weed before and I didn't really know her stance on harder things. So we hanging out one Saturday and I offered her some ice. I figured we snort a little, fuck for 6 hours straight and in her mind I would be an absolute porn star. Win-win right? Well she wasn't to happy. Now I want to say this girl is the most fascinating human being I've ever met and the most absolutely gorgeous woman on the planet. I want to marry her but I'm probably not good enough for her. I'm definitely not good enough for her. So I tell her it's no big deal I just came across it and figured we would try it.  I threw it away and that was that. So my dumbass continues to mess around with it on the weekends and now it's creeping into the weekdays quickly. I eventually tell my girl the truth and she advised me to leave it alone if I want to keep seeing her. Well, she a fucking dime piece and worth it so I do. For a few weeks. Then what do I do? I get high at my house and post some shit on /r/Stims because I was spun out. She knew my user on Reddit. She saw it. Game over. I'm like holy shit how fucking dumb can you be to let her walk out of your life for fucking meth? But what does she do? She tells me she loves me and just wants me to be ok so we can be together. This girl is a real sweetheart. I mean real life fucking sweet heart. This was 3 weeks ago.

#### Last Weekend

I got a fifth of Jack Daniels and some pot because I'm in an active addiction. I can quit anything if I have something to replace it with. I haven't been doing anything for a few weeks and decide it's time to unwind. Cue Sunday, me and gf hadn't had too good of a weekend, didn't get to see each other, had some hard news to accept. Sunday my coworker calls and says he's got an even better deal on dope. Well I've got Jack Daniels whispering in my ear that is indeed a good idea. Went and picked up and was a nervous wreck. I had promise gf the entire world. I would never do this shit again, that I chose her over dope because she is totally worth it. And I meant every word of it. So now how the fuck did this happen? So I work at the same company as gf and she's not there Monday which was actually good  since I was spun and had no sleep the night before.

####TUESDAY MORNING.
  I see gf walking in the door at work. She takes one look at me and gives me the eye. I knew right away that she fucking knew. How this girl knows me so well and sees completely through my bullshit that has yet to fail me is beyond me. She loves me. I asked her what was wrong and she immediately says ""I think you are on drugs."" Oh no baby, not me. I spew line after line of bullshit and it's not working. I can see her not buying any of it. I feel terrible. I've told her all these lies and she isn't buying it and I feel so trapped. If I tell her the truth, I'm going to lose her. If I continue lying to her she's going to resent you and leave you later. And I feel terrible about lying to this sweet woman that actually loves me for me and all my flaws.

####Yesterday

I drive around the part of the state i live into customers homes. I was going to a vacant home and I had one line left of this shit. I have never been able to dispose of any drug of any amount. So I was glad this was it. I had maybe 5 or 6 hours of sleep since Sunday morning. My hope was that I'd do this line I could get some distance from all this with gf and I could hide all this. When I went back to the office yesterday afternoon I could tell something was going on with gf. So I asked her, hey what's going on. Again she says, ""I think you are still on drugs."" It's almost like she has a 6th Sense. Oh no baby, not me. I left the office a little while after that and all the guilt and shame of the lies and deception hit me. What was I doing to this woman? I finally decided that she deserved better than my piece of shit ass and I'd tell her the truth. And if she left she'd be better off and my punishment of a life without her would be just. So I texted her because I'm such a pussy. I told her she deserved better than what I could offer her and she should never talk to me again and that I lied to her about doing drugs and that I was sorry. She said Thanks for telling me and that was about all. I couldn't called out if work today because I just didn't want to see the disappointment and anger on her face. She did reach out to me and said, ""I've yet to say what I'm doing in this relationship."" So she is very angry at me and rightfully so. I've violated her trust I've lied about drug usage and I'm really sick of all this shit. Drugs and alcohol have ruined every major relationship I've ever had. Got me locked up in prison for 5 years. Taken untold amounts of money from me and now is about to drive the nicest, sweetest, most beautiful woman I've ever had the privilege of knowing away from me because I'm a fucking drug addict and I'll finally admit it.

1154,addiction,2020/03/12,"Can one go to drug rehab if they’re not ready to quit alcohol? // If this is wrong subreddit, I’m sorry. I couldn’t find one dedicated to relatives of addicts. //

My younger sister is nearly 20 and has been using alcohol since she was 15. For ~2 years she had an addiction to that but last summer she started using drugs (ecstasy, amphetamine, tranquilizers + weed together, cocaine) and is now severely addicted to these. 

We managed to find her a rehabilitation clinic that seems perfect for her and she’s willing to go – as long as she does not have to quit alcohol. She personally feels like she has no problem with it *anymore* and says that she can continue controlling it after she gets back from rehab and I want to believe her, but I also know that she was severely addicted to it only less than a year ago. The only reason for her being able to control it, in my opinion, is her addiction to drugs. She just simply switched the target. 

The rehab lasts for 27-35 days and she would stay there 24/7. After that she would continue visiting the clinic once-twice/week for 11 months. This costs €6200 (roughly $7K) that we need to pay from our own pocket. We can afford that but only once and I’m scared that she will throw this chance away just because “drinking is fun” and “I like dancing”. 

No matter how much I try to educate myself on this subject I don’t seem to understand her reasoning. I know that addiction is a disease but does she really not see the problem that she has with alcohol? If she’s willing to let go of drugs (which seem to be way bigger problem to begin with), why can’t she go all in and let go of alcohol as well? 

Tl;dr: 20-year-old sister is willing and motivated to go to rehab for drugs, but not for alcohol, but she was an alcoholic before she started using drugs last summer. Does it make sense to go to rehab now or should we wait until she’s all in?",370,0.0,0,0.0
1155,addiction,2020/03/12,"Addicted to nitrous oxide Hello out there,

I know I'm not the only person with this addiction as I've watched stores go from stocking small amounts to huge amounts of whippits as us addicts feed them our coin. I've seen other people buying huge bulk amounts that aren't for ""casual use."" I remember doing my first whippit at a psych party at least 8 years ago. I just did one and it flipped my world upside down for 30 seconds and I loved it.

I started doing them on my own by myself not too long after. First it was just a box or two at a time. But now I can go on multi-hour binges where I huff down 600 of the things in a day. When I'm done, there's whippits all over my room or car (if I'm hiding out from my roommates) and I shamefully find a dumpster to take them to and hope no one sees me dumping all those little clinky canisters. Sometimes I can still hear one I missed rolling around under my car seat. I have a pounding headache and for some reason these things make me lose weight (dehydration?).

I had a really bad weekend and huffed on Sunday, then had to leave work early on Monday to go huff, and then took a sick day Tuesday to do more. Spent yesterday resting and now I'm back at work and my feet are on FIRE. Long term use of nitrous causes neuropathy through b12 deficiency. I've been addicted to these things for 8 fucking years and never gone more than a couple months without them. But I binge so hard now, it messes up my sinuses (feels like I have bubbles in my ears) and causes this horrible neuropathy. It cuts me off socially and takes me a couple days after a binge to reintegrate into society.

This stuff is pure evil. It was such a wonderful interesting trip the first while that I was using them, but now my life is living hell. I want to quit, I've wanted to quit for years. But as soon as the fire stops in my feet, and the pain and anxiety of life ramps up again, as it always does, I will just want to escape into hours of huffing nos.

I started using it when I was 18. My mum passed away in 2016 when I was 21, from then until now weed has helped me slow my brain down enough that I can cope with what has happened. It was gradual, I didn't used to smoke much but it became more, and more over time. 

I've was smoking a hell of a lot every day back in November/December and I cracked in December and had somewhat of a breakdown due to work and from then I've yet to return. In that time my life has fallen apart more than I thought it ever could. All I did was smoke weed and play video games all day. 

At the end of January my partner left me and cannabis was there. I kept waiting in the lonely house we shared smoking and just waiting for her to come back. I tried to kill myself 4 times and was in a dark place. 

I've been staying with family for the last week and I haven't been smoking. I've felt emotions good and bad that I haven't felt in a long time and a clarity that I haven't felt in an even longer time. 

I realise now that my ex left because shit couldn't keep going on like they were and she wasn't going to come back to exactly the same situation so I made the conscious decision to make myself better, at first it was for her but at this point in time it's for myself, because I am worth more that what I was doing when I went off on sick. 

I have somewhat of a plan for the next few months that will get my mental health in check and hopefully win back my ex, I am doing this for me though. No one else, if I can win my ex back it's just a happy side effect of the effort I am now putting into myself. 

All my paraphernalia is staying with a family member who smokes so my expensive bong and grinders won't go to waste.

Sorry if I have any grammatical errors, or if formatting is wrong, or anything else that typically pisses off your normal Redditor. 

I’ve had an on and off relationship with opiates for about 3-4 years. Started with Roxy. Could barely do a half a 30 without puking an hour later. That went on for about 2 years, me and my friends lost our usual plug so I stopped for a while. One day I’m working (I work at a bar) and a bartender who knew I did pain pills said he had some H if I wanted it, because I usually hook him up. I took it, told some of my friends and then a week later they had found their own plug to get the H from. I could never buy it like them, spending $80-$150 on a bag of dope that would probably last a week at best. I just liked to get high and get away, but everyday I woke up I wanted that feeling again. So it continued on and off. I’d maybe do it 3 days in a row, take 2 days off, and then go back. This goes on for a year or longer until Tuesday. 

I get off of work and know my boy needs to meet his plug. I ask to take a ride and tell him I’ll trade him some weed if he breaks me off a little bag, which he agrees to. We go to the spot and wait for the D man to show up. While we wait, me and my friend hit the rest of his bag he has left. After about 15 minutes l, the plug pulls up, my boy gets the stuff, and we leave. I drop him off home, take my bag with me and go to pick up my girlfriend. (She had no idea I was doing, neither did my parents or my little brother.) me and her get back to the house and it’s just a normal night. About 11:45 me and her are in my room. My parents are asleep but my little brother is in his room doing whatever he does. I decide I want to hit some, so I tell my girl ‘I gotta run to the car to grab a juul pod real quick.’ Run to the car, quickly scoop out what I thought was a good dose into my straw and snort it. My nose was kinda stuffy so I didn’t really even feel how much I got at first. I run back inside and before I open my door I snort as hard as I can to start my drip, and boy was it a big one. 

I hopped in bed and laid down immediately. I don’t know why because at the time it felt like a normal nod, but I told my girlfriend I didn’t feel right. About 3 minutes after that I was knocked out. I obviously couldn’t see what was happening, but hearing the stories from my family are horrific and I honestly never wish this kind of trauma upon anyone. 

They said my fists were clenched and impossible to open as well as my eyes. I turned white with my lips and fingers turning blue. I gasped for air like my life depended on it and then stopped breathing for 30-40 seconds at a time. My little brother (18) had ironically taken some CPR/breathing classes and knew a little about what to do in the situation. But thankfully they acted almost immediately. My girlfriend said she heard me snore but it didn’t sound normal. She shook me and said my name but I didn’t respond which is unusual because I’m a light sleeper. She ran to my brother and asked him to come see. He immediately went to my parents room, and once they saw me they made the decision to call 911. While on the phone explaining the situation the first responders show and he knows exactly what is happening. He runs to his car, grabs the Narcan, then shoots it up my nose. A minute passes and the paramedics show up and they get me on a stretcher. As they’re about to take me out the house, I wake up. I just hear my mom saying my name. I look around and I see the paramedics, then the police, then I lean further up and see my girl and family. I lay back down and all I can think is ‘Fuccccck’.
You can only imagine how insane it is to wake up to some fucking strangers hovered over you saying ‘oh he’s up, he’s good’. Holy shit...

If my girlfriend wasn’t there, I would’ve died for sure. If those first responders wouldn’t have been so on top of their job, I would’ve died. 

It’s a surreal feeling. Like I was given a second chance at life. It was the ultimate lesson. Everyone in my household knows now. There is no hiding it anymore. 

While I wanted to make this post to share my story, I also wanted to share this to tell everyone to please be carful. You never think it can happen to you, until it does.

1183,addiction,2020/03/14,"Scared Shitless Feel free to browse more of my posts for some back story, but for the short version... I’ve been on and off drugs for as long as I can remember but because of underlying mental health issues (depression and anxiety) relapse is something I’m really familiar with. 

I’ve been to quite a few treatment centers including making it 6 months in a Christian treatment center but I always ended up back on suboxone and a few months ago started feeling like I need to come off of it. Mainly because I don’t want to depend on anything but also because I’ve felt called to work with plant medicine (Ayahuasca) and I know I don’t need to be on anything in order to work with it. 

Well, about 3 months ago I started to try to come off of it by switching to Ketamine and what I planned on being a short period of time on Xanax. I did get down to a low, low dose in the process but obviously I can’t beat the forces of addiction and before I knew it I was completely addicted to Ketamine and Xanax. The original plan was to basically come down on the Subs and switch to a short acting opiate (which obviously heroin was the least expensive one and therefore the one that made the most sense in my mind). Bad idea. 

A month ago I was at such an all time low with my depression and the shame and guilt that comes along with mental health. I set out to kill myself, with fentanyl and Xanax. Plan failed. 

Ended up in behavioral health for a week where they detoxed me but ultimately without adequate treatment for mental health, I was setting myself up for failure. But in the back of my mind, I know if I’m ever to be able to work with plant medicine (not even just undergoing it myself but acting as a guide for others undergoing the ceremonies).... I can’t be on anything. 

Flash forward to now being at my grandparents in Mississippi who were so kind to give me a place to live, but after finding my drugs, took my keys and although it’s MY car my grandfather said he would call the cops on me since he still has the drugs he can pin on me. He wants me to get clean the good old fashioned way... “You’ve just gotta quit. You’ve done those treatment centers before and they never work.” It’s so frustrating when family doesn’t understand the bigger picture and that they can’t empathize with the fact that addiction is like the diabetes they have... it must be managed. 

My argument is that if I was to go to a 90 day or 6 month program, it would give me a better shot at a life without drugs. But the problem with these programs is they’re pretty intense (I have no health insurance). I’m a very spiritual, not religious person, and these programs are very religious oriented. But beggars can’t be choosers, right? 

I’m just wanting to get some opinions from people who don’t really know me and can look at the situation objectively. 

My end goal is to find purpose and true healing, and I truly do feel called to work with plant medicine (although at the same time it terrifies me). I know my life will never be easy but I do believe it’s possible to find something remotely close to a life of peace. It’s just a matter of what that looks like, to reach it.

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Devan. I started using when I was only 15, it all started with my wisdom teeth. Something completely innocent, right? Well, what I didn't know but would soon find out, they prescribed painkillers for certain procedures. They gave me Vicoden after my surgery. I had a pretty rough child hood, diagnosed with Diabetes Type 1 at the age of 10, dealt with a lot of depression issues from my diabetes and hormones being all sorts of out of wack. Unfortunately, I enjoyed Vicoden. My grandma (Not a day goes by I don't regret this) used to be prescribed Oxy. After my Vicoden prescription was out, I began sneaking Oxy's. The first time it was very intense. I ended up being so tired I passed out and woke up the next day for school, not realizing how dangerous what I had done truly was. Fast forward to age eighteen, my first love got me into smoking weed. This was during the rush of the fake Marijuana usage, K2, JWH-18 etc. We began smoking K2. I had a friend that seized in front of me, and had to be put in a medically induced coma over it. Oddly enough, you would think that would have been enough to stop me. It only stopped the substance I was using. ""A drug, is a drug, is a drug"". From there, it only got worse. At 21, I had become an alcoholic within a year. 5ths every night, 30 racks, whatever I could get. This lasted for a long time, until about age 23, when I met my current wife. I had quit drinking! I finally did it, and I was sober for some time. From everything this time. I thought that I had finally made it out. So, I thought. My wife and I went through a really hard time in our relationship, which caused us to separate. Over those few months, 2016-2017 we were separated, I began experimenting with harder substances. It started with Cocaine at a rock concert, from people I thought were my friend. They told me to just try it one time, if I didn't like it they wouldn't push me again. Who would have thought they would never have to push me again, because I would ask for it. Cocaine is very expensive, and harmful. One day, my buddy said he had a great deal from a guy he knew. So, we went and got the drop. I knew immediately after using, that it was not what I had thought it was. What we had been given was Shake and Bake, extremely dangerous, thermogenic amphetamines. ONE single use, transformed me into a full blown addict. For months, I slept from place to place, watched my ""friends"" kill themselves over this substance. Finally, I had a moment of clarity. Sitting there staring at a dub, asking myself, ""What the F\*ck are you doing to yourself?"". My dealer, who took me in when I was homeless, sat me down and he talked with me. He told me that I am a good kid, I have no charges, I'm smart, and in good conscious he couldn't keep feeding my addiction. He wanted me to get clean. This was following my moment of clarity, by only a few hours. So I did, I called the only person I knew who could help me. I called my wife and told her what was going on, I was so desperate to get clean.   


On my final comedown, I had been up for 5 days straight. I was hallucinating, desperate for it to end. My wife took me in, I slept for 3 days. Only waking up to use the restroom, eat 3 bowls of cereal just to throw it all back up (Graphic, I'm sorry, but this is important). My sober date is January 13th, 2017. I have not touched a single substance, no drugs or alcohol period. I started homeless and hopeless. I now am an Communications Engineer, I have two children, a house, cars, anything we could ever dream. This woman put aside everything for me, nursed me back to health, and stayed by my side while I recovered. As for my dealer, he did something for me that saved my life, literally. Not only did he stop providing my habits, but he was a Confidential Informant. ""Operation Freefall"" locked up the majority of people that used to use with me. He gave me a second chance at life, a chance to build a future, with my freedom and record intact. My wife, gave me a second chance at love, and showed me that there are things that drugs could never give me. She gave me hope, she gave me two beautiful children. In a beautiful symphony, I had been blessed and rehabilitated. All the pieces fell into a perfect picture, creating the man I am today.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, as the title states, ""How did this affect how I live my life today?"". I am a musician, an engineer, a father, a husband, a brother, a son, and at the end of the day, a man (at least now). I went through some unimaginable hard times. All addicts have a story, and this is mine. A girl I used to use with never quit. She unfortunately had to have 2 valves on her heart replaced from an infection, and she tragically passed away December 23rd. I walked through the fires of hell, and gratefully, I made it out. Now, I spend my time trying to pull others out the same way that these people in my life did. I spread awareness, hope, and love. I work closely with people going through recovery, I write to those in rehab (Pen Pals) as well as a clothing like called DreamXL who the owner is an ex addict as well. We work hand in hand to change lives. He does it through speaking, his business and story. I change lives through my story, but also through music, by sharing the darkest parts of addiction with those who might not understand it.   


I can never change the things that I've done, the people I've hurt, and those that I've lost. But I can learn from them, and help mend others who might need that same hand that reached for me to pull me out of the flames. 

 ""God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,  
Courage to change the things I can,  
And wisdom to know the difference. ""

So i posted a few months back about my addiction. I was addicted to ‘speed’ (which is basically meth powder). I’ve not been using speed anymore. At the moment a smoke a lot of weed and very rarely maybe something like cocaïne. Last friday night i used cocaïne and ketamine. I was with people that i barely knew, but i could defenitly trust, they are frequent users but very responsible. I felt really awkward that night because i wasn’t entirely comfortable. The next morning i had a hangover because of drinking i thought. I think that something has triggered me and it feels wrong. So saturday i felt aweful. The feeling usually goes away after a day so I didn’t feel panicked. Right now it’s sunday and i woke up fine, feeling happy maybe. After six hours i started to notice that I don’t function properly.

So I'm currently in the middle of trying to fight a nasty drug habit; I've been a poly-substance abuser for years but it's in this past year that I've started to fixate on opioids. I've had similar stints with booze, clonazolam, adderall, and MDMA but nothing this bad. I've abused a lot of substances, but the only kind I've used and not developed a fixation of some sorts with is LSD and psilocybin. I enjoy but respect these substances unlike any other kind, and in fact it was in part due to these substances that I started to understand I was in fact an addict and that I need to stop.

1196,addiction,2020/03/15,"Why should I stop using drugs and alcohol for her? This is a throw away account. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to start by saying, I know this already sounds terrible, but I truly, genuinely do not get it and I need a serious perspective change. Long post, sorry!

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and i have been together for 8 years. I am 12 years older than she is. She met me in a bar and took me home, that night. I was a junkie. Cocaine, heroin, crack, pills.. I would do any of it, if it meant feeling good. I had been doing all of these things since a young teen and everyone loved me for the party animal that I was. I was shooting up and drinking around the clock - literally. I never ate or slept (except a few hours every week) and partied ALL the time. It never stopped, for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a year, I stopped shooting up. I knew my health was declining and I couldn't keep the party up. My wife (girlfriend at the time) was trying to change me into someone that didnt drink or do drugs. I also went to alcohol detox for the first time, but it didnt stick. I drank the moment I got out. She had kicked me out several times over the year for staying gone for days, bringing friends over to party (she never ever drank or did drugs. She went to work and school), and she was tired of it. Each time, she would ask for me back. We really did have fun, though. She was down for anything. We went out every night. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward some years later. I had completely stopped using hard drugs. I only used opioids and drank. I decided to switch to methadone because it promised a better life. Each of the drugs caused bad side effects. I went to detox again to get off of methadone and alcohol. It stuck for a while, but after a few months I was drinking. again. She was still down to go out with me, whenever I pleased. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to detox for the 3rd time. I came out and it stuck another few months. But, the same scenario repeated itself again. I went to detox again. 

&amp;#x200B;

This time, it stuck a little longer. I started snorting cocaine again, though. We were married by this point. She truly did try to have fun with me, even though she said she couldn't stand the cocaine use. She begged me to stop, but would just go out with me again the next weekend. We fought. We broke up over it several times. The drinking got awful, again and I had to go to detox again. 

&amp;#x200B;

This time, something really changed with the way I view alcohol. I stopped drinking, for good. But, occasionally I have had a drink (yes, this is considered not drinking, for me, as I seriously used to drink around the clock. One or two drinks once a week is nothing to me). The times that I have really went all out, and my wife comes out with me, we have such a bad time. We fight. She cant hold back her anger for me using coke and drinking. She says she absolutely hates it, but is still going out with me. (I dont understand why!!!). 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, my wife decided that I could not drink or use drugs around her, anymore. The first couple of weeks, I stuck to it. Then, got her to come out with me again. Of course, we fought really bad and shes absolutely refused to be around it ever again. 

&amp;#x200B;

She says she wants to go out with me, just without the drugs and alcohol. She says she cant relive the terrible nights we have had because they really take a toll on her mental health, when I can just sleep it off and be fine by Sunday. 

&amp;#x200B;

We used to go out and have so much fun. We never made plans. We just went where the party took us. Now, she demands to know if drugs or alcohol will be involved, if so, she wont go. But, I'm not going out without coke or alcohol. It isn't fun to me! 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night, she said we could try something different. We could go to dinner, then ice cream, then to an arcade. I refused, without drugs or alcohol. I ended up going out without her (she had planned the night around me and didnt even pick anything up for dinner) and ended up staying gone until today at 4. I've slept since then. She was so angry at me. I feel like a prisoner. I feel like a teenager on lock down. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why doesnt she want me to go out? Why should I have to stop using drugs and alcohol, when it makes me happy. Seriously, what is the harm in it and why cant she accept that I will use and drink?  

&amp;#x200B;

Please, dont be rude. I genuinely do not understand what the big deal is. I am a man that is doing the same thing I've always done and I dont understand why it is so unacceptable now, when in the beginning it was perfect.

1197,addiction,2020/03/16,"I'm addicted to prescription amphetamines and it's slowly killing me Hello all, I need help and don't know who to turn to. Sorry for the long wall of text, just have a lot to get off my chest. 

I got prescribed Vyvanse for ADHD 2 years ago with great initial success. Like many who have used this medication, I started at 30mg and my life instantly changed for the better. I lost weight, improved my grades, and pretty much got all my shit together. I was in love with the high it gave me and the increased motivation. I felt unstoppable and falsely believed that the feelings I was experiencing would continue every day for the rest of my life. 

Eventually I slowly started upping my dosages and persuading my doctor that I needed more for it to remain effective. I am now prescribed 70mg (maximum prescribed dosage) and more recently in the past month I have been taking 140+mg every day. I don't want to take this much but I feel compelled to when I wake up in the morning and even if I overcome the initial urge and just take 70mg I end up taking more later in the day anyway as a booster because 70mg doesn't get me high anymore. I'm addicted to the rush of vyvanse, caffeine, and nicotine and it's hurting my cardiovascular health and my sleep patterns. I've been going to bed late and waking up early to take more because I keep thinking that if I take a big dose super early in the morning, I'll finally be tired by the time I should be in bed, but it never happens. 

As recently as one month ago I exercised regularly, maintained a healthy diet, and enjoyed a vibrant social life, but as of late I've started working from home and going out to socialize less and less, prioritizing getting high over exercise and socialization. With the corona quarantines in place in my city, I can't even go to the office to escape my living room because it's closed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been having major chest pains and sleeping problems this past week. I'm living a very sedentary lifestyle due to that fact that I am currently recovering from the flu, which I think I got in the first place from lack of sleep and lack of self care. As a result, I do not get tired enough to sleep well at night. I'm also worried about exercising at a high dose and hurting my heart even further. The vyvanse suppresses my appetite so much at this point that I'm also getting inadequate nutrition. I want to stop, but I'm worried I cannot maintain school/ the life I've built for myself without it.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently see a therapist and have talked to her about this but we go weeks inbetween meetings and I struggle to implement self-improvement strategies. What do I do? My health is declining rapidly and I'm in pain :( I'm worried that the part of me which wants to quit will cave in tomorrow morning and take another 140mg.",544,1.0,2,0.003676470588235294

I've had to take almost 1000mg to get to feel better and get back to normal... I know this dose can kill a person but my tolerance is so high that I don't worry much but I am still careful about no taking too much. It started yesterday morning and I took the 1000mg Tramadol to get through the day.

as time progressed I was neglected as a teen and basically homeless I was molested for years when I was barely 3 or 4 and I’ve never really had a break things hit it’s worst when I lost my first kid at 18 then went through hell and back because the girl I had lost the kid with took it out on me even tho it was something medical she physically abused me and verbally well I just took it why not I was on so many drugs at the time and being the biggest man hoe you could imagine I couldn’t go a second without something well life fucked me and she got pregnant again but it stuck and I was excited and things looked up for me but no she was this monster and she took off while she was pregnant to spite me and gave me the promise of getting to be in my kids life well it was bs she told all my friends and most my family that I had beat her and raped her when I did no such thing and everyone believed her I was no where near to back up myself up and got delt the shit end of the stick well she gave birth and teased me with my kid sent pics here and there then disappeared I was already in such a shit state I was huge alcoholic and drank 24/7 she would continue this for few years and even after moving closer so I can finally meet my son I was give 5 miserable minutes with him all while getting degraded and stuff in front of him and just bunch bs then off she was again things spun out and I was drinking and popping pills left and right not to long after I got in some mess with my brother cuz he went and jacked all my stuff from my house cuz he was a dick I persuaded him to come over to get high and as soon as he got in distance I beat the fuck outta him my older “thug “brother was completely pumbled and he had my father and grandmother mad at me because family doesn’t do that etc etc needless to say I was mad and packed up and left last thing me and my dad talked bout was pretty much arguing and telling me to be kind to him because he doesn’t know better yep ..so I moved and stayed to myself for most part and life came crashing down again..this time my father was diagnosed with cancer and had maybe a year left this effected me a lot and I was just getting settled in to my new place and job and had planned to go stay at hospital with him  for bit we talked every day and I was promised so much and my worries were put to rest a bit well my phone ended up running outta service and I didn’t get paid for another 2 weeks I had no way of getting ahold of him and my bday was coming so one my buddies turned my phone on And I was flooded with messages and missed calls turns out my father passed on my bday and I just lost it still makes me tear up thinking about that exact moment...worst of all the funeral was a bunch of drama and my baby mama ended up being there for some reason and I got to see my son for first time in years my grandma forced me to get close to them I was not wanting to but I did and felt something for once and was genuinely happy I was promised more time if I stayed few extra days in town well I stayed 2 weeks and not one call or visit I spent 20 hrs on a greyhound back home and I was in the worst mood ..got home and began coping ..well alcohol was my buddy until some co workers turned me onto coke and meth ,coke was my stuff for most part id run through a 8ball every other day plus I shared with sum friends just to “keep “ there company eventually coke wasn’t enough for the depression and pain I had and I turned to meth originally meth was a once a month thing since it was so intense but quickly I replaced coke and stuck with meth ever since I was hardcore on it binging for months and combining all sorts things and snorting and smoking it like nothing I was hardcore on it for 2 years ended up In hospital numerous times and struggled to get sober at first I’d go a week or 2 then come back and binge in the worse way eventually I got to the lowest point and I hated meth but had todo it even tho I was getting nothing from it but I was able to get sober and stay sober for almost a year literally days shy of it then a old buddy came on the anniversary of my dads death and well I caved in and broke it I would get fucked up for few weeks then quit in a huge struggle I would throw my stuff away and start with withdrawals I did this nearly every few months then got into pills yet again and Then again got sober yet again then got on meth again ended in the hospital recently since my tolerance was low I was hitting it like if I was on it constant and stopped for good while but recently have struggled again and used for a week threw away my stuff in anger and disgust then week later back on it and this is kinda were I’m at currently been a week and been up for most of it I neglected to mention a lot of other issues but it’s not really important I guess plus it took effort to even open up now..I’m in a shit mood due to arguing with my wife and all this bs and I’m close to just dropping everything and going or just snorting my whole bag it’s a pretty big sac I planned to be positive instead of negative I had a solid plan to get sober and stay sober I don’t wanna die and don’t wanna use it’s almost like breathing it just happens worst of all when there’s so much negativity and bs to deal with I was doing good living off a bump or 2 a day I was happy I started new job and felt confident and happy and was sticking to my plan for sobriety I was taking what I learned from numerous times of use and withdrawals etc and really tried to do better I couldn’t just go cold turkey couldn’t afford to sleep for days and recover so slowly I was wheening myself so withdrawals didn’t take such a toll and it wouldn’t effect work but bs happened and no matter what I said or anything it was disgarded because it was to much of a burden for her 1-I’m not bad or ugly on stuff Im very happy and productive I accomplished months of work that had to b done to our house in 3 days and even took my wife out and spoiled her  2-she told me to be honest and open up to her because the way she can be I hide when I fuck up and use and only tell her once I wanted to get rid my stuff and be clean just to have some support she can be very ugly and make things worse so I keep to myself and only have myself as support and what not to get sober  but apparently all I do is talk about drugs and bs everything she said was bullshit and wouldn’t even let me talk because a druggy is a druggy and will make excuses I’ve never had the need to I’m the most open person I’ve told plenty I’ve done drugs and struggle with addiction its nun to brag bout but I’m honest it’s nice to get props for coming a long way but yeah it was a cluster fuck so I gave in and I was that druggy I broke my plan and I’ve take lines every few hours I don’t get nun from it it’s pointless but it helps the pain just lil and I’ll take what I can get ..I pretty much ignored her after the argument and struggled not to give in but I did and I stayed to myself until I had to go to work I wasn’t even excited to go I was all fucked up and didn’t care then received all these texts from her at work  and how’s she’s done and all this stuff cuz it’s a stress on her and she has to be there for me all of it’s bs because she zones me out when I try talking I don’t even come to her cuz I know the outcome and she made everything about her but nothing was valid so I’ve used more than I have in forever I got past a point of fear and more less like fuck it I looked up a drug help group thingy because I didn’t want this def at the extent I’m going I want help it’s very hard to do it alone and so I told her few hours ago that I’m going to go to one but she got mad because I need something other than her it was another cluster fuck and I snorted half my bag and now I’m here typing so I don’t focus on my chest bursting I’m sorry to bore anyone with this I’m just talking and opening I’m not one those proud users I find it stupid that I was when I was at my worse I’ve learned and grown but can’t escape addiction especially since I know what works best for me I’ve come along way just to fuck up again and

1203,addiction,2020/03/16,"Roommate has had it with me over duster: ""quit or I'm getting a new roommate"" I developed a duster addiction relatively recently - around November or December 2019. I don't know why it started when it started, it just did. My parents had 2 cans that had been sitting around for awhile, and I guess curiosity got the best of me, so I decided to try it with those. It was really, *really* nice, but nothing I was obsessing over. When it started out, a can lasted me days, cos I would do maybe 4 huffs in all and be done with it. I'm at a point now where I just tore through 8 cans in a night. 

Apparently, I make a lot of noise when I get high on duster. I scream, and vomit. I know this because my roommate and his girlfriend found me passed out in my own vomit one night after they had heard yelling from my room...easily one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. I didn't even know it happened till the next day, because they had texted my best friend saying they were worried, and she chewed me out for it (rightfully I suppose).

Even after they caught me, even after the embarrassment of knowing they know now, I kept doing it...and I went harder and harder. I've been able to hide it from most people, but my roommate has had to deal with it more than anyone else.

He told me straight up, I have to stop. Its already a problem that I often can't pay rent on time (because all my money goes to duster and weed) but the fact I'm always doing it and he's always having to hear me/worry about me is wearing him down. I can't blame him. But I don't know what to do.

Does anyone else have experience with duster addiction? How do you stop? How do you even begin to get yourself off of it? Its so different from any other drug I've had, and it's so easily accessible it's ridiculous. People compare it to whippits a lot but they're like 5x as intense as whippits to me, and the craving for more is just so overwhelming. The high is so quick you just want more and more and more. 

It's such a fucking pathetic, embarrassing addiction to have, but I have it. And I just need help. Or some people to talk to I guess. I have no money, no friends anymore because of this and I just want things to be ok.",447,0.0,0,0.0

1210,addiction,2020/03/17,"I am addicted to masturbating and I do not know how to stop 20 M here from the United States. 

I have come to this subreddit to ask for guidance for my addiction problem. I am absolutely addicted to masturbating (and perhaps porn as well). I naturally discovered masturbation when I was probably 4 years old, but I did not realize that it was masturbation until I was almost in middle school. Once I hit puberty, I was jacking it maybe once a day, more or less. At the time, it feels amazing and natural, but afterwards, there is an element of shame and dissatisfaction that lingers.

Although I am 20 and feel that my time with puberty is soon coming to an end if it hasn't already, I cannot help but feel that my amusement with masturbating is still very high, and I did not realize that it was an addiction until a few months ago. Here is a list of some reasons why I realized it was addiction:

1. I would skip important events, risk being late for school/classes (I'm in college), accidentally skip time to be with friends for the sake of masturbating (I enjoy lengthy sessions)
2. I would risk being caught by family members and roommates to an extreme degree (to this day surprisingly I have never been caught with dick in hand)
3. I would actually pay money (which I do not have a lot of) towards my desires (sex toys, porn memberships, Snapchat premiums)
4. I have a girlfriend as well, and although we have refused to engage in intercourse until marriage, we still engage in sexual activities in other ways, which for me, usually involves handjobs and fellatio. Sorry for the graphic image, but I think this is important because she is technically giving me masturbation, and I fear for this because I believe that it deteriorates my libido for actual intercourse. The positions that we do during this is always the same and we have done this a LOT. So much so that it is starting to become difficult for me to maintain an erection if I am not in a certain position. 
5. Although I still love my girlfriend very much, I know masturbation can have disastrous consequences long-term on romantic relationships, which I very much would like to preserve.
6. I lose/waste SO much time masturbating that I lose sleep. I will masturbate for around 2+ hours a session. Not because I cannot climax, but because I will edge myself continuously until I feel that it is the right time to finish.

Every time I am about to masturbate, I tell myself, ""This is the last time and then it's done."" But it's never the last time. I'll make other excuses, for example, since I'm currently on spring break, I could say ""Since I'm home doing nothing, and it's more difficult for me to masturbate in a college dorm, I should jack off as much as possible while I am at home and get it all out of my system so that I am satisfied when I return to college"", but the problem is that I believe this is what reinforced my addiction to begin with. It's also reached a point that as soon as I see something lewd or sexual, maybe on TV or in person, I have to make some time within the rest of the day to masturbate. There are some days when I can manage to not masturbate, however, but there are others where it can reach up to 4 times. These days, the common amount is twice a day. 

I do not know what to do. I thought I could beat this on my own because I find this subject kind of disturbing and embarrassing, but I am running out of options. I hate this addiction, and although it's one of the best experiences when doing it, there has never been a session where I did not feel disappointed in myself afterwards, especially now that I know what I am doing is contributing to my addiction.

I don’t do drugs, and haven’t even experimented beyond the handful tries of weed over a decade ago. But the lies, manipulation, money, people stealing from my house, mood swings, anger, sudden bills and debts I have to pay for, I just don’t know when I give up and accept that I am enabling him more than helping him through it. He continues to distance himself from me, spending all of his time with people that supply him drugs or people that buy drugs off him. He says he wants to be clean and to be with me and move forward in our lives with common goals, but I fear he is just telling me what I want to hear, just to smooth it over for a bit until the next time I find burnt foils  or baggies. 

I keep telling myself there has to be a line, that I have to leave and let him figure it out and realize if he wants to overcome the addiction for himself.

1216,addiction,2020/03/17,"Pro Tip For Recovery: DO YOUR TAXES (Canada Tutorial) If you’re seriously recovering and have worked part time or worked at a crappy job during your addiction DO YOUR TAXES WHEN YOU GET SOBER.

Thankfully this process is complicated and lengthy enough to make it less appealing as an addict who wants immediate cash for their habit. I’m so thankful they don’t make it easier because this money is seriously helping me get back on my feet.

I started getting my life together and hadn’t filed my taxes in 6 years. I just filed for 2015/2016 and I got close to 8k back today! I’m using this money to pay off tickets / debt and help start my small business. This can be a very well timed boost for people in recovery. It’s seems like a daunting task when you’re constantly on something but when you’re straight, it’s not all that bad.

Step One: If you’re like me and havent filed for many years you may have to get physical copies of your T4 and provincial tax forms. Easiest way to do this is just to go in person and ask for the copies. I looked up Revenue Quebec and took the bus/metro to their offices in downtown Montreal. They were very pleasant and I was in and out in under an hour. The copies of my Relève 1s arrived 10 days later.

While I was there they gave me some dollar amounts that the Canadian government could use to identify me over the phone (amounts that would show in can govs records)

I also asked them to print my last two notice of assessment forms from the last two years I filed. For me it was 2013 and 2014.

Step 2: Call the Canadian government and use the information you now have on hand along with your address and SIN to identify yourself. They may have an address you’ve forgotten about so go through all your past addresses and write them in notes on your phone. Once they have successfully identified you they will send you the necessary forms. 

Step 3: Wait 10 business days for your tax forms to arrive. Once you have them head over to H&amp;R block. Believe me filing paper taxes is complicated and you’re better off paying them the $100 bucks so you don’t have to do it yourself. They will ask you questions such as “we’re you single that year” and “did you live alone”.

These questions relate to tax credits you get from the government. If you had a girlfriend living with you for 2 weeks don’t mention it. If you lived with her or him for 5 years it’s better to be honest as you are common law at that point. 

Once the hour long appointment is over they will tell you how much you’re getting back and for 20 bucks they will take their fee out of the return so you don’t even need to pay on the spot. 


I had to figure this all out myself and it wasn’t easy. Let me know if you find this useful or have questions.

I had done research but did not exactly know what to expect. Still, I thought it would be a one time experience. Well, what I got was far too good. What was that? An enthralling and tantalizing euphoria that dominated my life? Nah. What I got was inner peace within my head. Quiet. My constant ruminating thoughts ceased for the first time in as long as I could remember. Music sounded better too, but I couldn't quite place my finger on how. I felt like I could actually apply myself to what I wanted too. Wow.

I was already acquainted with a psychiatrist and therapist at the time and told them about my attention issues and the like. I didn't lie, I didn't even exaggerate. Script acquired. I'd convinced myself I needed this. A close friend of mine has been treated for ADHD from a young age and vividly remembers her father saying, ""here, take this, it will fix you"" upon her first ritalin prescription. I don't think that's an appropriate thing to say to a clueless child who's beliefs hinge on the words you say. Please don't tell children they are broken, they might just believe you. Regardless, I had convinced myself I was impaired in some way, and maybe I am, but this was not the solution.

I started college. I made so many friends. I met girls. Had a strained relationship. I joined some clubs. Academically I preformed highly and even made the deans list. But in reality, this was not sustainable. I was only functional 5 days a week and spent the other two eating ungodly portions of food and sleeping. I shouldn't even say functional, I was pushing myself far too hard. I was more sociable than ever and while socializing on the medication left me feeling oddly disconnected and awkward, people kept telling me how articulate and confident I seemed.

Tolerance. I was irrationally afraid of tolerance. I have read nearly every god damn post on this subreddit that mentions the word. I was taking weekends off, and two to three week-long breaks when I could afford it during the holidays. I told myself I was retaining the efficacy of my medication. In retrospect I was chasing the initial feelings it gave me. These were the only feelings I had anymore. I'd become oddly detached from reality and was structuring my existence entirely around a drug. This was very much turning into an addiction, but an addiction I was applauded for. From an outsider's perspective, I was accomplishing so much.

I was falling apart at the seams. Life got hard, life tends to get hard, its how it works. One day I let myself dose on Sunday due to workload. Then that became every week. Then I took an extra dose. ""Nothing to worry about, only this one time"". Hah. As my prescribed dose escalated so did my intake. This drug helped me pull my life together and I made so many excuses to rationalize my behavior to myself. I was up for two days, and when I seemed concerned my peers told me to give myself a break. Look at how hard of a worker I was! Look at my GPA! I should be proud! If only they knew. Well, they do know now because I've told them. I should never have relied so strictly on only my own perspective, it's innately flawed and bias.

I know that in about 14 days I'll start to feel normal. Thats what it typically takes. I do not care if my grades may begin to suffer. I can't swim against the current forever and be surprised when I get knocked by a wave. I refuse to medicate away who I am. Trade aspects of my personality in order to attain grades in order to make money. That's hollow. I feel hollow. I am typing this from my bed which I feel glued to.

Along the way I made some guidelines to keep me on the path. If they help anyone else then maybe I can save them years of trying to figure some of this out. If not and these are already obvious then you are smarter than me.



1. You have to want to quit.

All the self-help books and all the support groups in the world are not going to help you if you don’t actually want to quit.

2. Find a reason to quit.

Any reason outside of yourself that can make you accountable. Start small and build from there.

3. Redirect the the urge to something good. 

As an addict I have the superhuman ability to pour all of myself into something that gives me joy. Replacing the bad behaviors with something beneficial can help help while keeping you busy.

4. Never get bored.

I’m a machine of habit when I get bored I get back into whatever habit that’s easiest for me. 

5. If needed remove the people and things that allow you to continue the addiction. 

This one sucks. It hurts to lose someone that was close to you but when the people around you aren’t helping you then you need to think about what you really need to do and sometimes that means cutting people out. This goes for inanimate objects as well.

6. Find anything that works for you.

What works for you may not help someone else. What works for me might seem alien and totally unreasonable to somebody else but as long as it keeps me clean then that’s what I need to do.


7. Get help if you need it.

You don’t have to do this alone. If you feel yourself falter or begin to fail there are thousands of people that know how to help and might even know exactly what you are going through.


You are all awesome.

You can do this.

Hey there! 
I’d love to get your feedback on my situation. 

First, let me give you a little bit of a backroad about us: 
Gay couple. Married. We’ve been together for about 6 years. We’re  in an open relationship and it works well for us.

Situation: 
I found out that my husband is down to parTy(pnp, smoking crystal meth and then have sex).
I saw it when he was chatting with one of the guys on one of the dating apps. 

IMPORTANT: I asked him before seeing it if he tried T(crystal meth) or not. He said no, and he said he would never do it. 

Then I saw that he said definitely yes to pnp in one of the conversations on the app. 

We talked. He said, that yes he tried it one time only with one of his fuck buddies and he did not like it. 

My hubby has an additive personality. He likes to drink but it’s under control, he knows when it goes out of control and takes a step back and gets back to normal. He does smoke a lot of weed, but it doesn’t affect him in a negative way. 

I feel like he might be lying to me about that one and only time, as well as that he doesn’t like it. Why?  Because if I tried something and I don’t like it, I wouldn’t do it again, right? But in his conversation he was quite down to parTy and he sounded a bit exited about it. Granted the guy who texted him wanted to get fucked up and have sex. My hubby said “hellz yes!” I think it’s a clear indication of excitement lol. 

We talked. He blocked that guy who he partied with. He blocked the guy who asked him to parTy with him. 
He said that he doesn’t wanna see other guy except a couple of fuck buddies who according to him do not do drugs. 

He also mentioned that he part took in using heroine with one of his friends. But it’s only one time thing and he doesn’t like it (I kinda believe it, his friend ODied on heroine long time ago and after that he wouldn’t do it)

He doesn’t wanna use dating apps anyone because of what happened. He said that he wouldn’t use crystal meth again. 


What should I do in this situation? I don’t see changes in his behavior. In fact until our conversation, our relationship actually was getting better.

I’m afraid that he might be on a slow track of becoming addicted to T.

The days that i did not take it i pretty much couldn't function because i was so tired and i slept over 12 hours a day. Does this mean that i am addicted to it? i do not have cravings for it or anything but i am kinda nervous now that i realized i was pretty bad at functioning without it.

It took a tole on me for sure feels like trying to go to sleep without is impossible. But it's not so bad as is it now.

Some backstory:  The addiction didnt start until a few months after our marriage and now we're 3 years in. Went from opiates to heroine to rehab to kratom. He hid his addiction for almost a year before rehab, then hid the kratom. And lied twice about stopping. The kratom is legal, yes,  but hes abusing it and I believe it caused a seizure that fractured his shoulder among other health problems. We tapered him off because he wanted to get clean, now I find another bag again that he lied about until I found it... (a common theme with him is to deny EVERYTHING when I bring up concerns, until I find proof and even then hes reluctant) He says he just got too anxious one day and needed ""an out"" and hereeeeee hasn't found an outlet for his anxiety yet that isn't substances. At least not one he likes as much. 

BUT when things are good, they're great... but eventually he starts using in secret again. Eventually I find out somehow, after usually weeks of paranoia and anxiety on my part. I feel paranoid and anxious and when I tell him this, he reassures me every way he knows how... (it's starting to not work as much anymore and I'll still feel at least a little crazy) Sometimes I can push it to the side and we have great days still, but then I find proof hes using and I feel hurt and betrayed that he lied to my face again. I tell him I don't trust him, and my anxiety disorder had this running through my had that may or may not be true, like if he's gone to the gas station too long, is he using? What did he spend $X on st the gas station, gas or kratom? So yea technically ""it's one lie, only about this"" but it permeates and irres affecting my mental health and our relationship because he KEEPS DOING IT. 

Does this cycle go on forever? Because I'm questioning my marriage. Does the good outweigh the bad? Is the sheer amount of love I have for him worth the crisis mode i fall into when I find proof of his lies? We've gone through this same cycle at least 3 times and I'm TIRED. It's to the point now where we were in this EXACT situation 4 months ago, and I don't feel like talking about it, because I feel like we JUST DID. He says hes not perfect and he makes mistakes, but the same ones?Will he ever learn to stop lying, and at least trust me and tell me the truth? Are there any success stories?

I used to be addicted to anxiety medication 6 months ago. I would take 4 or up to 6 pills a day. I don’t even remember what it felt like to be completely honest because it really messed up my memory. 

Anyway, I landed in the ER because I eventually took one too many (not a suicide attempt) and my liver was a mess. So I’m not on any medication anymore due to my liver. Recently I’ve been craving them again, but without a prescription I can’t get any. Instead I substitute my “craving” by taking random over the counter pills. Tylenol, Advil, sleeping aids, etc. Unlike my anxiety medication these are way easier/cheaper to get. I usually double or on rare occasions triple the dose. 

I don’t know why I do it as they dont make me feel high. Sometimes they just give me a stomachache and headache. I’ve also been tempted to mix the pills with cough syrup, but I haven’t gotten to that point yet. Has anyone else had this issue before?

1268,addiction,2020/03/22,"I’m contemplating relapsing even though it will tear my relationship apart. I’ve been sober for two months or so now, and I don’t think it’s going to last because I didn’t get clean for me. I stopped using Crystal because of the strain it put on my relationship. In January I moved from CA to OR and live with my gf. When I first came down it was only suppose to be for a couple of weeks. I had a couple weeks worth of glass and I was using in our apartment. My drug use has been a constant source of fights between her and I for most of our relationship. She moved from CA to OR before I did (last July) and while we were doing distance I had never brought my shit around, and every time I would drive up to see her, I would get clean. Then I’d end up going home and almost always immediately, end up relapsing. Whether to cope with feeling lonely, or deal with weight gain from sobering up and replacing drugs with food and binge eating. Last Christmas was the first time she’d ever come to CA to see me. She didn’t even come down for me specifically. She came down to go to a friends for a Christmas party and conveniently enough, I lived close so she stayed with me. We fought constantly over me using. We end up going to Arizona for actually Christmas Day because aside from me being a shitbag junkie, another reoccurring theme in our relationship is she gets her way. Going back to the previously mentioned distance. I always made the 9 hour drive from CA to OR. She used school or work as an excuse. Even though she went to fucking Canada with her dad and had no problem coming down for her Christmas party. Whatever. I’m not close with my family so I go with her to AZ for Christmas to be with hers. She forced my arm a little bit, but I did make the choice as an adult to go. So, were in AZ and I’m using right in her face, or at least not trying to hide it. We bicker about it here and there. In my eyes, this is the only thing keeping me going. All the stress I’m under, all the driving I’m doing, all the fighting. I always have a pick me up and something to keep me going. I’d be up for days at a time, often driving distance during the holidays. Getting belittled and having to deal with her talking about ex’s, or friends, and all this positive shit that isn’t me. Because she doesn’t talk about me. I’m not (insert real name here) to her. I’m (male shaped figure just barely good enough for her master plan for life). She doesn’t respect me. I caught her talking to an ex while we were together for the holidays. She lied about it repeatedly and finally I get the truth, or as much as she’ll give. Fast forward to present day and we fight about me venting to some girl form Dutch Bro’s who gave me her number. Not someone I have history with, no flirting, no touching. We talked for less than a day and all I did was vent how I feel. She won’t let it go but her talking to her ex is fine. Back to AZ, she has called me out for my drug use one night/early morning and proceeded to blame her miscarriage on drug use. I told her I never knew she had been pregnant and apologized. I asked when it happened. She tells me it was mine and then lied about telling me when it had happened. I pressed for answers and she hid behind her feeling of fear of telling me. Which is a literal toxic layered cake. She doesn’t try to help me with my addiction, and then (knowing that a child is the thing I want most in life) blames me for a miscarriage, of a pregnancy I knew nothing about and if it was real, probably wasn’t even mine. Then proceeds to take high ground by making me out to be some asshole that would get mad at something out of her hands. She also has no proof of the pregnancy at all. Nor did the doctor even say anything about drugs. She had the miscarriage and googled some shit, and just jumped to that conclusion among hundreds of possibilities. This same morning she confirms that she had been raped. Then proceeds to take me to a mountain to watch the sunrise. My stomach was in knots and I hadn’t slept in days. I just had more emotional pain dumped on me, after spending christmas doing meth in some hotel in AZ with no family or friends around to miss me if I OD’d. Now I’m thinking she wants me to fucking kill myself. We end up leaving almost immediately and going back to where we were staying. I was broken for a few days. I couldn’t hear anything about kids, or sex without wanting to break down. I didn’t know what to say, or ask. I didn’t know how to help. But I still tried to put a face on and meet relatives and be somewhat of a presentable boyfriend. The only thing that let me do that was insane amounts of sniffing and she still called me out every time. Even if I smoked a cigarette to avoid breaking, she’d scoff or complain. Fast forward to present day (skipping a lot of fights that were never resolved and some ended up getting physical) I’m thinking of going home tomorrow. Just to visit and get a few things. But then I question why I live here. Why I’m going if I’m just gonna relapse and we’re gonna fight. Why I even let my guard down and broke walls for someone who doesn’t respect me, belittles me, would choose any ex over me in a heartbeat, and rejects me. I hate that being lonely is as scary as it is. Because it’s enough to make me want to relapse, which brings on one of my biggest fears.

1269,addiction,2020/03/22,"What does opioid addiction feel like? Hi beloved reddit community. I'll cut the story very short. TL;DR section down below.

My husband has an addiction to opioids (oxy). He was addicted before he met me. Some weeks ago, he went through hell by withdrawing, it was the most terrible and terrifying thing I have ever seen in my life and I thought my soul shattered into 1000 pieces, seeing him like that. Anyways. It happened now that a couple of weeks ago, he relapsed. He successfully withdrew again and is back on Bup.

Now I have a couple of questions for the ones who have experience with opioids. Since I have never ever done any, I was wondering:  


* What does it feel like when you are on opioids?  
All I observe is just slurred speech, pin-sized pupils, very very slow motor reactions and slow thinking process. But I don't know what the person feels inside. My husband tells me, it feels like ""being wrapped in fluffy cotton"". Is it really, though?
* How does temptation feel like when you are exposed to the drug again? Can you resist? What is it that goes through your mind?
* When you are in idle time, do you think often about the drug? What are the thoughts? 
* If you are on the substitute drug, do you still have the temptation, what is going through your mind? Do you still have a craving? 
* What is there that I can do to help him and build a strong support system, so that he is not tempted to go back?

I have approached my husband and have had many talks about this. It is a very delicate topic and he gave me some insights here and there, but of course not everything, as all this is very deeply rooted to his (mental) past and so on. We are working on it but it's really hard for him to unravel all that and talk about it. Feels like therapy sessions, digging deeper and deeper but I don't want to overstep boundaries, if you guys understand. However, I'm his wife and I want to support him and understand him in the deepest way possible.

Can anyone willing to share with me their experiences?

Many many thanks in advance.

I heard reddit had some good recovery posts, this is the first one I stumbled upon. 

I smoked weed the first two days of lockdown.  I'm an adderall addict.  With the CA lockdown, I can't go to meetings and I think I used that as an excuse to get weed. I do feel somewhat guilty about it but mostly I felt empowered walking into the pot shop and getting legal, relatively safe drugs opposed to hitting up some friend to sell me their adderall. 

Lately I've felt a lot of condescension coming from my AA family and I don't really feel comfortable telling my sponsor about relapsing;  I won't really get support I'll just get like scolded and told I need to do a bunch of this and that because my program hasn't been good enough. UMMM THE WORLD IS ON LOCKDOWN IM STRESSED AND NOT BECAUSE I DIDN'T GO TO A WEEK OF MEETINGS... that's what happened the last time I had a brief relapse on adderall. I must have been doing something wrong that's why I relapsed; but if I stay sober it's because of AA and only AA, it has nothing to do with me.

Been battling with various addictions for years so I decided to knock them all on the head for 2020 due to declining physical health and concerns about my own mental health.

Stopped smoking cigarettes a week after that and dropped my antidepressants about 2-3 weeks ago entirely, after tapering off them for a couple of months.

One who's addicted to something, that's within the mind. It's a chemical imbalance solely. On the other hand, being dependent means that your body requires it or you're going to start having possibly fatal withdrawals because of it. I'm addicted to coke, ice, and H (although, H seems rather infrequent these days.) But I've developed a physical dependence, yet. Important to consider whether someone's addicted, or physically dependent. If one of your loved ones is addicted to something, it's likely that they're missing something else in life. It could be missing the sense of achievement, sense of family or community, anything. That's something you could work to fix if you're close to them. Being physically dependent on the other hand, is a matter of willpower and outside help, ex. clinics and suboxone.

***How childhood sexual trauma influences adult men ...who sleep with men.***

Post topics:
Addiction- Recovery 
Trauma 
Sexuality 


Hello Reddit world.

This is my first post- After years of confusion- seeking answers- shaming myself - working towards healing - I finally decided to take this to the world to find out where others stand with this. 

Specifically with men(although I know this affects women also)
I know there are men out there that struggle with this exact same thing as me- I am trying to find them- I have met a few along the way.
But there is such a lack of support when it comes to men “like me”.

Here is a quick version:
When I was a child - between the ages 6-9(hard to remember exactly) I was convinced by another boy on the street to engage in sexual behaviour(details not important)- this was a first for me. It opened a world I knew nothing about. However I was intrigued- curious - and above all I trusted this other boy whom was a couple years older.

At some point this switched - what was going on didn’t feel right to me anymore- what was first a rush of positive emotions had quickly turned into something I was ashamed of immensely.

I obsessed over this experience- crying myself to sleep- questioning my sexuality- I had been sexually traumatized and I suppressed this.

Little did I know I would be struggling with the same type of feelings 2 decades later.

In my early 20s I was introduced to mdma - from that moment my life had never been the same.

Drugs changed my life- but I will only comment on how it applies to the childhood sexual trauma.

Typically cocaine or crystal became the main ones for these sexual escapades.

Being under the influence allowed me to tap into a part of me that was - conflicted- confused.
That inner child left questioning between what felt good and what right(or wrong).

I found myself getting trapped in a cycle of using drugs- seeking out same sex encounters- and being filled with shame, guilt and remorse after EVERYTIME I engaged. Not to mention the  crazy fear of thinking I contracted something - specifically HIV 

Sometimes I did it sober- but only because I could NOT stop obsessing - and I felt in order to relieve me of this I’d have the compulsion to act out- again- I hated myself for doing it. The act never lasted long- it was just something I felt I HAD to do.

I identify as straight- I am extremely attracted to females- in all aspects.
When it comes to these men - it is a different type “attraction” if I would even call it that.

So what am I attracted to? The fact that is was taboo? Because it was something different- it was “forbidden”. Maybe I had unfinished business.
A psychologist-  Joe Kort calls it returning to the sexual scene of the crime - childhood sexual trauma does not orient but disorients.

Also Pleasure is pleasure- I feel as though every time I engaged in that behaviour I’d hope that I’d feel differently about the outcome. But it was always negative and in turn I reinforced those feelings I experienced as a child due to the sexual trauma. The ones that told me I am inherently wrong for this. How could I “enjoy” something that was wrong. 

Once I did drugs I was inhibited to do what I wanted without feeling guilty. Again a whole new world was introduced to me and I have been struggling to overcome  this for years.

Truthfully-  I just want to connect with other people who have been struggling with this- to see where they are at in their journey. Maybe they have overcome this. Or on the other hand-  still are acting out but they have a family. Living a double life.

Although I am not with anyone and don’t have a family - I couldn’t help but feel like I lived a double life. So much shame.

I’d like to keep this all inclusive- meaning if there are parts of my story you don’t relate too- but others you do- please focus on that which you do- the similarities not the differences.
All input matters- this is a space to heal.
I’m getting my voice back- owning my story so it looses its power.

Thank you for letting me share.
I look forward to hearing what people have to say. Not sure this has ever been talked about on here.",777,0.0,0,0.0
1278,addiction,2020/03/22,"A closer step to realization Hey y’all, 

I’ve been prescribed alprazolam (Xanax) for a few years now. I initially had bad anxiety but after some time I started to realize that I love the feeling of not caring about personal issues that drive my anxiety through the roof sometimes. But sometimes I feel like it’s getting outta hand. Like yes I’m prescribed, but nowadays I catch myself taking them throughout the day due to boredom, if I’m being completely honest. 

I’ve never gotten to the point of overdosing, but it has gotten to the point where I’m functioning all day, every day on bars. If I’m not on bars, I get bored and feel like something is mentally missing. 
I can’t tell if this would be considered a substance abuse problem or if I’d be considered an addict. I’ve come to this realization a while ago, but would really like some support or advice as to helping me figure out if this could potentially end up being a bigger problem. 

I would also like to add that I never really black out on Xanax either. But it definitely does make me feel zoned out/disconnected from reality. Which is a great feeling, but lately it’s started to affect my academics. I could be barred and laying in bed all day with no motivation to do anything whatsoever. And be completely content with this, knowing that I have other responsibilities to take care of. 

Has anyone gone through something like this personally?? Where they feel the need to be on xans or any other anti anxiety medication 24/7?? Just wanna make sure I’m not the only one going through this state of confusion as to if I have an addiction issue or not.

A few years ago, my friends dad had gotten back into meth. It has gotten worse over the years and he is now homeless, balls deep in his addition, with his extremely possessive and controlling girlfriend. 

 I am really close to their family and have always treated this guy like a father figure. I've reached out to him over Facebook quite a bit, but he doesn't reply, or when he does, it's for a game invitation to 8-ball pool.

1281,addiction,2020/03/22,"Getting by as an addict in the time of Coronavirus ""The opposite of addiction isn't sobriety.  The opposite of addiction is connection"".

This is one of the many sayings that we addicts know by heart, but this one has always hit home with me because I know that deep down my addiction soothes me because I am lonely and feel unworthy of the rest of the world.  Whenever I reflect on my acting out behavior I ultimately know that I'm trying to fill a hole in myself that can only be filled by connecting with other humans. My vice isn't important, because no matter if it's drugs or alcohol or sex or gambling or food we are all throwing it into the hole that can only be filled by connecting with others and learning to love who we are unconditionally. 

Over the last few weeks the reality of Coronavirus has hit home.  I've been acting out more, but the disturbing part is that I've been excusing my acting out due to Coronavirus.  The reason I've allowed these excuses to become a part of my life is because I've suddenly been told that I'm no longer to have that which I know can help me.  I cannot connect with my brothers and sisters in meetings.  I cannot connect with my family.  And I am not allowed to find new people to connect with.  As responsible people we have to ""social distance"" so that we can all stay safe.  But ""social distancing"" is just a fancy word for isolate.  And any addict worth their salt knows that isolation is the exact behavior we have to avoid if we are going to stay sober.  It is our road to hell, paved with good intentions.

I don't have an answer for this.  I just want all the other addicts out there who are suffering under these conditions to know that I'm thinking of you and that you don't suffer alone.  We have the tools to make it through this, and we will come out stronger in our sobriety.  Our addiction does not own us, and it will not make this any easier.  Please be safe and stay strong and lets all make it out the other side.  I don't know you, but if you understand what I'm taking about and can relate I love you.

1288,addiction,2020/03/23,"I disagree with the definition of the 'addiction disorder' I believe addiction is not a single overarching disorder but much more complex than current medical science and neurology accept.  


for one i dont believe it is a lifetime illness that 'never goes away' either -- i think what 'never goes away' is a sort of mental inclination along with potentially other non-treatable (or poorly treated with modern psychiatric drugs) mental illness that lead to the enduring desire to go back and re-experience or use again.  


however i would say that not only does addiction end with post withdrawal -- that once someone is free of constant urge and withdrawal they are no longer addicted -- but that each individual drug has a unique addiction syndrome and is NOT related to other addictions regardless of the fact that certain reward centers of the brain are held in common.  


this explains why each drug user has a different DOC, why actually one can use their DOC again and quit immediately (though this is not advised and is a risk, it does NOT ALWAYS end in re-addiction and i have proven this personally. its anecdotal, because I AM THE test subject and the test holder, but its true, just unlikely and a serious risk because if you believe that you 'can get away with it' and do it again and again you get yourself back into the cycle.  


this cycle is not created by addiction tho -- its a mental inclination for the reward which endures. the feeling. I would say that each drug you experience this differently, and depending on your state of being mentally, either affects or does not.  


for example i could smoke crack every day for 10 years and suddenly stop, feel better in 3 days and move on like nothing happened. other drugs tho this may not be the case for me.  


this is because my personal set of mental disabilities and struggles lends to the benefit mentally of one specific type of drug over all others -- because it helps. the urge to get help is mainly the drive here.  


so its a set of disorders, multiple disorders, that cannot be treated the same or considered the same. treating people addicted to sex, the same as video games or crack or heroin or PCP is not going to work. each one is unique and characterized by different symptoms and root causes.  


the only success ive had staying off drugs has been outside of AA and NA, denying the supposed definition of addiction and acting alone. Ive done everything they say not to (use drugs to quit drugs in substitution, deny the supposed research, continue use of alcohol on a limited basis etc)  


and im 100% fine. not an alcoholic, not a problem usually. Im one of the 1/1000000 who actually had enough willpower and intelligence, with tons of years of struggling, to actually make it work.  


and even if it is insane odds for a person to make it work. the fact that i have proves something. if im not onto something, then i shouldve failed.  


but im not on maintenance. i dont take anything. i dont go to meetings.  What they say works didnt work at all and what they say couldnt work worked wonders.  


its tough though. ive tried to advise others on my quit method. most of them abuse the quit drugs and never stop getting high. it requires absolute strength of will, high intelligence and great wisdom. you also need godlike willpower.  


if you arent prepared to be tortured in war and not give up information to the enemy, you dont have enough willpower.  


but on in a million will die before talking. so if you will then you can do it. you just have to masochistically suffer for about 6 months to a year.",656,0.0,0,0.0
1289,addiction,2020/03/23,"I'm a 22yo trans female, and i just relapsed on cocaine. Let me start by saying I was sober for about 6 months. This is the second time I've relapsed (the first time I was also sober for about 6 months). At first I was so ready to be done with it, I was glad to be giving it up. It was so difficult coming out of the haze that I was in. Coming down was like being slapped in the face with reality. I cried like someone I loved had just died. To finally feel clarity after all that time was so... different... and it took a lot to adjust.

I've always struggled with depression, and anxiety. Being transgender feels like it adds a layer of grief and self-loathing at times. I've always struggled with a lack of self-worth. I tend to not talk about it to anyone, just like how I tend to not talk about addiction.

Well... about a month ago my depression took a turn for the worst. My obsessive thoughts came back harder, and all I could think about was coke. I tried to reason with myself like I had done before, but this time it wasn't the same. I couldn't rationalize like I did before. I could feel myself slipping, and in a way I feel like I just let it consume me.

A week ago, I used again for the first time. Now we're in the middle of a pandemic and I have an 8 ball and nothing to do. I feel like it's only down hill from here... I fear that I'm falling back into this vicious cycle and it will be even harder to get myself out of it this time. I'm not sure where to go from here.",310,1.0,1,0.0032258064516129032

Also, how can you handle the situation if you do want to experiment with drugs and alcohol but are afraid that you might have an addictive personality and might get hooked to it?

Addictive personalities show obsessive behaviours in friendships and romantic relationship as well. Like substituting a previous addiction with a new lover and then being completely addicted to them and feeling out of control. Does this happen to someone else?

I'm a PhD student in clinical psychology and also have a startup building an application called Help Club. We've officially partnered with SMART Recovery to build a pilot of our program program and are also funded by the National Science Foundation and National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Our goal is to provide VR-based recovery meetings, primarily through the SMART recovery format (teaching cognitive behavioral skills). This allows you to log in from home using your headset and join a recovery community, learn cognitive behavioral skills to cope with cravings/negative emotions, and be a part of a larger virtual community in a safe, protected space. (See our recent coverage on the BBC for a bit more info and context: https://youtu.be/yF_zIuAiiro )

We are currently recruiting a group of 20-30 people in recovery from any substances who own headsets and would like to attend our recovery meetings. Please let us know if you're interested by filling out this form: https://forms.gle/NqwHyeFactaWTsjT7
If you're selected, you'll be contacted to learn more about the platform and see whether it might be a good fit for you. It's completely free and we're hoping to start hosting meetings as soon as possible! Feel free to respond here if you have any questions.",239,0.0,0,0.0

1301,addiction,2020/03/25,"If you can't get your usual drugs because of the epidemic and might have to go through withdrawal, please read this! Hi there! I'm really concerned that a lot of people won't be able to get their usual drugs due to the coronavirus and might die because they don't understand just how serious withdrawal can be. I've already seen a lot of posts on this subreddit dismissing or making light of withdrawal. Please, read this with an open mind.

Withdrawal isn't a joke. We all know it's really unpleasant to say the least, but a lot of the time it's very dangerous and can be completely lethal. To the best of my knowledge serious alcohol, benzo and opioid withdrawal are all able to kill people. Even if your body doesn't just shut down you could still die through other means, such as seizures. I read a comment about someone who had a seizure from withdrawal, bit their own tongue off and almost choked to death. The mental health effects of withdrawal can be equally dangerous.

*Explanation of tolerance and withdrawal ahead*

I'm studying neuroscience and while I'm no expert on this stuff I think I can explain it at least in a simple manner. This of tolerance and withdrawal this way: Your body and brain works to maintain healthy conditions for proper function. We call this homeostasis. When you constantly drink or drug your body this becomes your body's new perceived normal conditions and over time your body and brain adapts to these changes. It does its best to try and get back to homeostasis in these new conditions, and makes changed to work towards this. The thing is that these changed take time to happen, and when you suddenly stop taking drugs or drinking your body and brain can't change back instantly. Suddenly they'll be working as if they're still under the influence of drugs or alcohol, but there won't be any substances in effect. These changed that your body and brain have made are really dangerous when you're not at least somewhat drugged or drunk and quitting cold turkey or abruptly can absolutely kill people with serious alcohol or certain substance dependencies. Your body needs more time to slowly adjust back to the way things were before you started regularly taking the drug or drinking, and so you have to taper off and decrease your dose over time to get back to normal safely. It isn't safe to self medicate and it should really be done with the help of a medical professional.

*Explanation over*

If your going to run out of benzos, opioids or alcohol I'd really recommend you see a medical professional. Trust me, if you live anywhere decent it will be part of their job to not be judgemental and to help you as best they can. I imagine people in the medical industry would just be happy you made the leap to reach out and get help. You are just as deserving of medical help as anyone else, and addiction is a completely valid illness that people shouldn't try to take on by themselves ❤ If you're at risk of dangerous withdrawal, please, make the leap and get treated. It would make me and I'm sure many others very happy if you did. At the very least, it's worth a shot. Worst case if you get medical help? You go through withdrawal is a comfortable, safe, supportive and controlled setting and you are probably weaned off with clinically administered drugs, with support against the pains of withdrawal. Worst case if you go through serious withdrawal on your own? You die. 

It can be difficult, I know. But please, take the leap and accept help through these hard times. The world would be a darker place without you in it. You are a wonderful and beautiful person and you can absolutely make it through anything that life throws at you! So please, if you're going to go through serious withdrawal, don't go through it alone 🤗❤",697,1.0,3,0.00430416068866571

After 4 days with no tramadol his therapist told him to start taking again as it's dangerous to quit food turkey. We decided he should start on 10 tablets a day but he tapered down to 4 within a week and that's when the memory loss started. He woke up from a nap last Sunday 22/03/2020, and he couldn't remember the morning, he was acting drunk like, slurring his words. I thought he'd taken something, was so mad at him, begged him to just be honest but he was adamant he'd not done anything. The next morning, he couldn't remember the day before, we went to the doctor's and he said the amount he reduced to so quickly was life threatening and to go back to 6 a day for at least 2 weeks then drop a pill every 2 weeks.

Its been 4 days and he's still so confused, all day he asks me questions and asks why he's confused it's so scary.

I'm new here. I'm an addict. There's a lot of meth where I'm at, and I haven't done any. I'm literally getting sober in a trap house because I fucked up my relationship with my fiance's mom, so it's the only place I have to go right now. Here's what happened, and I don't know if this is a place for me to vent or what, but I'm fighting so hard right now, so please allow this post to go through. I'm really struggling. I relapsed about 2 weeks ago. I was on a bunch of klonopin and did a shot of meth after being sober for 6 months. I took a pistol and shot all over the house, and ended up breaking my shoulder running from the cops. I was so fucked up that I called the cops on myself to ask for a ride to the gas station so that I could fucking rob it at gunpoint. I threw a fucking syringe at my fiance who does NOT use and has her bachelors in social work. So I have prior felonies, and I've already been to prison once, for selling narcotics to a CI. I immediately get searched when the cop arrives to give me a ride. I'm also pretty sure I shot a cow in the head with the fucking glock while walking down the dirt road. The cop finds dope and a pistol on me. SO in my state that is a class Y felony. Minimum 20 years, which on that I would do 1/6 of it, so it'd be about 3 and a half years before I'd be eligible for parole. I'm 23 also, just so you know. Anyhow, now I'm out on bond, and I have my first court date for simultaneous possession of a controlled substance and a firearm, possession of a controlled substance, and possession of a firearm by certain persons. ONE FUCKING RELAPSE, and literally everything is my fault. My shoulder is broken, and so now my fiance gives me her pain meds that she's prescribed even if I don't ask for them, BOOM - now she's in withdrawal, and my dirty ass is to blame. I literally have to live in a trap house up the road because it's the only place I have to go. No electricity, barely have running water, blah blah blah. Where as before I was living in my fiance's moms house and we were all contributing and I was sober, and things were great. I straight up burnt that shit. It's a miracle I didn't shoot someone in the head. I know I'm bitching and complaining, but my fiance snuck me in through her window, so I'm finally back in the house for a couple hours. Then my fiance is so loyal and amazing that she goes with me to the trap house and sits with me  to make sure I stay sober, because the house is run by a family member, and all I have to do is ask for a fucking bump like it's a piece of gum. I come from a good family, I come from money, I have seen beautiful lovely parts of life, and I'm stuck in a fucking shithole now. I did some gabapentin earlier. That's it.

It started with ""hey we're doing pills"" and next thing I know it's 3am and I'm 
walking through town with extreme paranoia


I'd like to think it's boredom that made me try my first high but fuck I know it was a way to harm myself, like when I got so fucked I really really tried to die


It seemed innocent at first, maybe I was tired, but then I looked in the mirror, I truly did fall apart


I remember my friend finding me and having to yank away the knife, I remember bashing my head against the wall in the hospital, and taking off the bandages


I remember convincing him to get us Charlie, having a seizure on weed, when I had a panic attack from ritalin so bad I clawed up my face and stopped talking


I think it's mostly guilt making me hate myself in this way, for letting things get so bad and for my mind being against me


When you left me all I could think was how life was over again, I'm so fucking tired of being left to rot as I try my best to rebuild myself for the 1000th time


That's when I heard of DPH, shit I wish I never learnt, in a way it's perfect, I can finally make myself be mad


I guess that's my end goal here, I don't think I have enough of a reason to be as messed up as this, maybe drug-induced insanity will get me the help I need


I still don't know how I hid the box so well but now we're in lockdown, and I can't go buy some more


I'm almost out of codeine, my weed is running low, and I'm trying so hard to hide from you the start of poly-addiction


That's why I smoked when we were on Lucy, but you smoked too much, I was supposed to be the one that got bad


I don't want to drag you into my slippery slope but your head's screwed on so I don't think you will


I guess that makes me sadder, you'll always be doing well while I'll be doing all I can to find something to get high


As you're working from home now I can only get away with so much, we're together again but shit I don't want you to see me getting worse


I wish I could say to everyone telling me to get off of drugs that I will and mean it, but it's impossible to when I know I'll take every opportunity I get


Will you still love me when I get worse? Will you give up? You gave up last time from my anxiety, shit I know you won't stick around


And I'm sorry


But I'm getting worse and I can't get help anymore, I wish I could but i'll always pick drugs


I just saw you smile and I know you couldn't love an addict. Sorry my love, but I'll be leaving soon, it's the only way I can protect you

1319,addiction,2020/03/26,"Think marijuana isn't addictive? Former users disagree  

In the basement of the Mustard Seed, a red brick building in Chicago's Old Town neighborhood that hosts dozens of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings each week, a handful of people gathered on a recent night to discuss a different addiction.

 

They were members of Marijuana Anonymous, a rapidly expanding 12-step organization that serves those struggling with a drug that is now legal in Illinois and 10 other states, and that many people view as innocuous.

That perception, some meeting attendees said, even extends to fellow drug users.

""When you're in rehab for weed, you don't say you're in rehab for weed,"" said Robb, a 30-year-old who lives in Chicago. ""Half the people will laugh you out of the room.""

But treatment specialists say marijuana's addictive potential is well-established. About 1 in 10 people who use the drug end up with the condition known as cannabis use disorder, meaning they continue to use compulsively even when it messes up their lives.

""It's a lot like the other addictions,"" said Michael Mahoney of Hazelden Betty Ford, a treatment center on Chicago's Near North Side. ""People want to stop using and can't. They have to use in greater quantities to get the same effect or just have a feeling of normalcy. Along the way, problems emerge.""

The Chicago Tribune spoke with people in recovery from marijuana addiction about those problems, the complexities of treatment and the reluctance of others to recognize the seriousness of the habit (as is customary for participants in 12-step programs, they asked to be identified only by their first names or no name at all).  
""Everyone I've told has been dumbfounded that it became an addiction,"" said Shelby, a 36-year-old woman from Chicago. ""It's hard for them to grasp that marijuana is addictive, and also that I used every day for the most part and no one knew. That's how secretive you can be, how good you can get at functioning on weed.""  
Shelby said she started smoking marijuana at 14 — the odds of developing cannabis use disorder are 1 in 6 for people who first indulge when they're younger than 18 — but it didn't really become an obsession until she moved to California as an adult.  
There, she said, the state's liberal medical marijuana law allowed her to buy the drug with little hassle (California has since legalized recreational sales), and THC-infused vape pens let her use discreetly anytime she wanted.

I'm at a loss on knowing where to go from here. I've worked in mental health for a few years as a mental health tech..so I'm not licensed in anything for THIS field...but Any who

In the last 2 months it has come to light that my brother has been using meth and I assume he has off and on for a while. It has been more apparent because of his behavior/appearance. He has always had a great work ethic and has never not had a job. 

 In a matter of a month of him learning to shoot up, he has had his car stolen, a rental car stolen, bank accounts emptied, lost his job, lost his place to live,  and has gone to jail for possession, and is on the verge of losing his rights to his child.  I have some experience working with people with addiction, but when it's your own family...its hard for me to find ways to cope with the thoughts of where he is
..who he's with...what he is doing...will I ever see/ hear from him again...how can I HELP him?!

What's hard, is watching what it's doing to my mom/ family. He has been staying with my mom off and on through all of this.  She has been helping him with paying for a different phone, when he needs gas money,  etc.  I feel like a piece of shit telling her to be careful... set boundaries... don't enable him.  Am I out of line/ cold?

...I've been trying to be strong and try to reach out to him and let him know that I will be there for him,  but I don't get a response. I haven't heard from him since I told him I couldn't/ wouldn't bail him out of jail.

1332,addiction,2020/03/27,"I think I am addicted to cocaine, how do I get out of this Sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit to post this to, just not sure where else to put it.

I first tried coke about 10 months ago. I thought it was fun but didn't really get what all the buzz was about, it was too expensive and the high compared to ecstasy was nothing. I took it a couple of times over summer and really enjoyed it, but like I said, the high was just not worth the money for me.

Then I got a job and my work mates took it every Friday's after work. I knew I had fun on it during summer, and now that I had money I thought what the hell, why not? So I started taking it with them, and obviously loved it. We didn't have a night together where we didn't do it, and we never ran out. This probably went on for about 5 months, and we probably took it around 3 times a week.

My other mates (not my work mates) liked it but couldn't afford it, so nights with them we would just drink. It was then that I realised that I couldn't just drink anymore. I would get extremely irritable after a few drinks, my heart would beat really fast and I would get really tired at like 12am. I would feel so unbelievably uncomfortable, while all my friends would be drunk and happy i would be sat there silently almost having a panic attack. My head felt like it would explode. This has happened every single time. I haven't enjoyed a night where I just drink for months now. I usually just end up going to bed, or say that I will buy us all coke as a treat and spend like £300 on it just so i can have some.

I honestly feel like there is no way I can just drink anymore. I guess I am not properly 'addicted' as I don’t really want it unless I am drunk. At this rate though I honestly think that I will never be able to enjoy just having a few drinks again, if i'm just having a night in with a beer all I can think about is how much I need it to actually enjoy myself. I can't remember what it was like to actually just get really drunk and enjoy myself, now it feels like drinking is just the prep for doing coke, and if i don't get coke my brain just switches off. 

I know after I say all of that, saying that I still really love taking it is ridiculous. But I do love it, and I am just hoping that it is my age and I will grow out of this when I'm older.

I’m 26F. I began dating this guy a few months ago. He told me he had struggled with addiction in the past. Heroin and meth. He made it very clear that he wasn’t using any longer and he was participating in an outpatient type of program , which required going 1-2 a week. Therapy. Uas etc. 

Things were great, we have a lot in common and hit it off pretty rapidly. 

However lately I’ve been starting to see some red flags exhibiting.  Some key examples would be,

• extreme insecurities to the point where he sounds delusional , the stuff he accuses me of or says I’m doing is so far fetched and insane. 

• mood swings , up and down. One minute he’s nice the next he’s very agitated. 

• always defensive when I kindly tell
Him anything he’s doing that isn’t healthy or respectful to me. 

•paranoia about others. Even his own friends and family thinking they are trying to turn me against him. Even though they never say anything remotely like that. 

• inflated ego. But then acts insecure at times. But is also overly confident at times , to the point it comes off delusional sometimes.  He will post on social media lives almost everyday about his life or what he’s doing like he is some celebrity. He even said he has fans and that I’m jealous lol. Even though I’ve never said anything about it. 

• he says every woman wants him. Co workers. Random strangers. He will try to make me jealous saying they all want him and I’m not saying that’s not possible however, I know it’s a lie. 

• he lives with his mother currently and is always broke despite having a decent paying job that is full time. No bills besides his cell. No car payment no rent. And yet he will be broke 4-5 days after getting paid. Which is every two weeks at least 800$. 

I think he is a functioning addict. His niece has told me she thinks he’s using again and ever since then it’s been on my mind. I don’t wanna come off as negative by asking him and him getting offended which I know he will flip and turn it around on me and not admit it if he is. I really care for this man and I don’t know what to do at this point nor do I know the signs of meth use. 

He sleeps every night. I know they say meth keeps you up but idk if that’s a stereotype but he goes to bed at a reasonable time. Is that normal if someone’s using meth or possible? And he eats a lot as well. 
But the other night I slept over and he was twitching ALOT in his sleep. His whole body almost. Like spasms and twitching. 


If anyone has experience with dating a user or ex user can you please tell me if I should be concerned or what signs that aren’t so obvious I can look for. I’m trying to be patient and positive and be supportive even if it’s as a friend. If he’s using I will definitely not pursue a romantic relationship with him any further. I can’t.

He has a history of substance abuse and fairly recently had a relapse, but he regretted it and it was like a wake up call for him at that point, but right now it's such a high stress situation and it's all so up in the air and uncertain that I'm really worried he'll fall back into old habits and redevelop addictive behaviours we've worked for so long and he's worked so hard to work through and overcome 

I'm high risk so I could go see him before the official lockdown was put in place, I've been isolating for a few weeks now, and he seemed fine while he was still able to go out to uni and get out and about but now he's stuck in his accomodation, and with not being able to go home and see his family and not being able to see me or go out and about he's feeling crappy and trapped

1347,addiction,2020/03/28,"Do I actually need help? Am I an alcoholic? Am I in denial? I've been sick with what doctors think is COVID-19 for a month now. I got tested recently and had to go to the ER because of the severity of my symptoms. No pneumonia, normal labs, normal oxygen level, so I didn't need to be hospitalized. Honestly I only reached out for help because this sickness was getting in the way of my drinking.

I can't stop thinking about drinking. I hate being sick because it gets in the way of my drinking. I tried to drink a shot from my hidden stash a little over a week ago, but I ended up projectile vomiting it onto the wall. I used a disinfectant with a fragrant to clean it and hide the smell. I lied and told my boyfriend it was water. He doesn't like me drinking, so I hide it from him.


I mainly use alcohol for school. It feels like it's the only thing that helps with my PTSD and stops making me feel hyper-vigilant all the goddamn time. I only drink a shot before class or if I need to work on something school-related. I don't know why, but I'm really productive when I'm on alcohol. I also kind of hate life right now and want to be drunk all the time.


I'm hiding this from everyone, including my boyfriend. He grew up with an absent alcoholic father, so he has some strong opinions regarding alcohol. I technically should be ""seeking help"" but I don't want to. I don't think it's really a problem, and I don't see myself as an alcoholic. It's not like I binge-drink frequently, although I can get pretty drunk when I hang out with friends which is rare these days.


Right now I just want to drink so badly. Just one shot, but I think it will be too obvious. I might have another reaction since I'm sick, and my condition has only gotten worse. I don't want my boyfriend to catch me drinking. I feel like he just doesn't understand. No one does. Not even my therapist. They could never understand. I'm really upset that I can't drink right now.",393,1.0,2,0.005089058524173028
1348,addiction,2020/03/28,"Information Addiction Step 1 # Step 1: We admitted that we were Powerless over Information; that our lives have become unmanageable.

**Tl;DR:** Stop trying to control Information.

As a hunter on the great plain 100,000 years ago you spot the herd you’ve been tracking for weeks. Your senses heighten—your eyes dilate; your muscles twitch with anticipation of your next move. Every fiber of your being aligns for one singular purpose—a successful kill.

In those hostile and uncertain times you could rely on two things—your body reacting to novel information, and your ability to focus on what this information is telling you.

Maybe in a sea of green you discover a splash of blue. Is that a bushel of berries to be picked and eaten and shared?

Is that rustling of leaves and a cracking of a twig in the pitch black darkness as you rest by the fire a predator poking around and hoping to make you its next meal?

Is the wind blowing in your direction protecting you and masking your scent from your imminent kill?

In this idealized and no doubt romanticized notion of early man’s existence relying on novel information was essential to survival. Ignoring it could be disastrous for you and your tribe. And not acting properly in accordance with what you’ve been taught by the gatekeepers of information—the elders of your people who relay the wisdom gained from perhaps centuries of failure and turmoil and death—help you become more efficient and effective for the group. Not adhering could get you and everyone you know killed.

The ability to focus and the ability to discern—two key tactics in our ability to survive. Period.

It is time to relearn those valuable skills in this day and age in order for us to survive.

What happened to our ability to do this and what can we do about it now?

Before these questions are answered, or rather, explored, we need to take a look at our main adversary of the 21st century—Information.

Information is neutral and cares not of your beliefs, values, opinions, or preferences. Information is all of these things, and much, much more.

What is Information? In a word—EVERYTHING!

The brain does not rest—it is constantly processing, recording, and transmitting Information.

And for most of our history it seems that this was the only technology in the known universe capable of performing these functions to such a high level.

This all changed dramatically with the invention of the computer.

In TK, John Von Neumann wrote his book, *The Brain and the Computer*.

In his book, Von Neumann says a lot of things that I can barely comprehend but that’s ok because this is the first draft and I’m here and we’ll sort it out later.

But the point is, the idea of using the computer as a model to understand our brains was introduced and the way of thinking is as old as computing itself.

This will be explored in more detail later.

Our brains and our bodies—the basic human hardware, has not changed much since it has fully formed around TK thousand years ago.

What has changed—significantly—is the software.

Where our brave and courageous ancestors rarely saw radical or life-altering differences to their environment and technologies—our current state is in perpetual change and flux and overload.

Even so back to 50 years ago when Alvin Toffler, the great futurist and writer, popularized the expression, “information overload” in his book, *Future Shock*.

Information overload was used to describe what future humans ,i.e. us, are going to be dealing with in our current age of information. However, even back then people began to feel the deluge of information of their psyche and the term became popular to describe their era of three television channels beaming information into their brains at home.

How quaint.

And now here we are with three or more streaming services in our pocket, access to all the information we couldn’t consume in a million lifetimes, and a video platform which has around [8 hours of content uploaded](https://www.statista.com/statistics/259477/hours-of-video-uploaded-to-youtube-every-minute/) every second. That’s around 500 hours, or 20 days of content uploaded every minute!

In the time it took to read that last paragraph, about a week's worth of content has just been uploaded. Yikes.

Social media platforms, designed to keep your eyeballs locked in, are working hard to keep your attention on them in a perpetual state of agitation—flight/flight and paralysis from Too Much Information.

“Big Brother isn't watching. He's singing and dancing. He's pulling rabbits out of a hat. Big Brother's busy holding your attention every moment you're awake. He's making sure you're always distracted. He's making sure you're fully absorbed.He's making sure your imagination withers. Until it's as useful as your appendix. He's making sure your attention is always filled.And this being fed, it's worse than being watched. With the world always filling you, no one has to worry about what's in your mind. With everyone's imagination atrophied, no one will ever be a threat to the world.”

More and more apps are developed every day to make you more productive or to help you meditate or focus or to track your screen time.

Is that really the answer you need? More information to combat information?

Is the latest and greatest gizmo or app the right call when you’ve never even developed a coherent and stable structure/philosophy of technology use?

What good is having the best sea-liner in the middle of Wyoming?

What’s the point of owning a snowboard in Fiji?

Why are you trying so hard to control the flow of information, and how is that working out for you?

Do you feel in control? Does your life seem manageable?

How effective are you at doing the work and solving the problems you are uniquely designed to solve?

Although it is useful to understand the flow and history of information, what is most needed now are new maps to navigate the Info-Universe we all inhabit and for most, are being crushed by.

The first step to recovering from an addiction is to admit that you’re powerless over it, and that it is making your life unmanageable.

Trying to control the flow of information—or even worse—trying to keep up with the latest headlines and gadgets and apps and trends—does not work.

If it did, you’d be able to shut off your device right now, step outside, and go for a walk and have no anxiety about what you’re missing out on with the latest tweet, post, or snap.

You could see others in the world and not nervously reach for your device to sooth your nervousness around conversation.

The song you hear at the grocery store could be just that—and not some song you must identify and look up and add on five playlists and share on seven platforms.

[Phantom vibration syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_vibration_syndrome), where you feel your device vibrate in your pocket when it’s not there, would not exist.

Do you still feel in control?

Again, the brain does not rest. So even if you’re physically unplugged from info-beaming screens for a spell—your attention and what you focus on, is still processing information and if you’re agitated by this and are frustrated by your inability to smooth your mind and be present and still then what are we to do?

Is there really a human solution—an app or a hack or your willpower—that can really solve this problem for you?

I haven’t come across one yet, and I think that’s the point.

What one may call God, The Source, Universal Consciousness, Higher Power, Simulation Overlords—whatever—is the overwhelming and awesome information that exists in all realms and planes and dimensions of existence.

Our ancestors understood this—and found great meaning in the stars and their environment and their community.

While the ideal of the individual in recent centuries has proven immensely valuable in helping us recognize the inherent worth of each human with a functioning nervous system to generate potential in either direction—good or bad, heaven or hell, etc.—what these computers have given us is an immense gift to our consciousness—a model of understanding ourselves—our limitations, our vulnerability and frailty, but also, our strength and resilience in dealing with adversity.

It makes about as much sense to me to say, “I am human” as it does to say “I am the Walrus.”

Because at the end of the day, we have NO CLUE what we are and what we are capable of.

Past events and experiences need not dictate future events.

If we can leverage our minds and leverage the vast potential of nearly 8 billion super computers walking around on this planet to get to work solving real problems that need solving for our continued existence and success on this planet and beyond—then who knows what we will be capable of and what we will become.

This is an attempt to create new maps to explore this vast and treacherous territory we are all immersed in.

For the opportunity to reach and inspire and empower others on a global scale has never existed like this before.

But it all starts with you.

So, if you’re ready for more in your life—more meaning and purpose and challenge, you must first surrender to the unfathomable power of Information and learn to become a vessel for its unique code meant for you to discern and focus on.

That all starts with a simple, yet difficult admission—that you are powerless over Information, and that your life has become unmanageable.",1663,1.0,1,0.0006013229104028864

Thought I would share it with you as I believe writing it was the first step for me to get off opiates. I found writing helped me figure out my story and where I came from. Even more importantly it got me thinking where I was going. Looking back on that time in my life is really interesting now that I’m finally off the junk and taking steps to fix myself from within.

Social Media

Growing up in North America during the 90's and onward was a pretty awesome experience, having the chance to look back and to reflect on my 30+ years living here, I finally realized this. Nintendo and skateboarding filled my time and life was easy. Having divorced parents gave me the chance to let loose as I had two homes and minimal supervision. As the Millennium rolled in and Y2K subsequently not happening, the world was busy changing and evolving, computers were becoming a more prevalent way of life and more people were succumbing to it. 

Walking home I quickly started writing, as I walked through a women’s protest against Trump being dispersed after their rally was finished. Having to walk against the flow of people was daunting, a person not walking in line with the majority. It must have triggered something in me, a desire to create flowed eloquently, like lava from a volcano into my mobile device.

I remember being in the bathroom in elementary when I heard about the twin towers. Everyone was talking about it. Classes stopped and all the teachers and students were all watching the event unfold in front of our eyes. It was an act of horrible human cruelty that I had never seen before being so young and I believe it changed us all in an instant. I also remember people cheering when they caught those responsible, also played out for us on television, I never actually saw them catch him, only what I saw on television to go on. I believed it as my parents did and everyone else did as well, the hive mind alive in us even that young. We were getting used to watching world event's displayed to us on televisions and we accepted this as a convenience to radio and prior technology. It was only a matter of time the majority of the first world would grow to love their screens and use them as tools to gain information and give fake information for years to come.

Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tinder, Snapchat, you name it, they got it. Choose your narcissist drug of choice in this game of information gathering. Hey! I am over here everyone, look at me. This is my butt, these are my boobs, here are those things again from a slightly different angle for the 500th time. This is my car, cat, mat, hat, shat, you get the picture. You name it they got it. I remember deleting Facebook and honestly it was one of the best feelings I have ever had, it was truly a problem for me, checking it constantly and making me think it was important.

I got into heroin a year ago around this time and boy let me tell you, it's been a hell of a year. I OD'd this one night when I was having a fire with the boys at our friends house down by the river, thank god my mate called the ambulance that night. The fentanyl they cut my heroin with made me pass out and stop breathing, the EMT told me later at the hospital, I had been unconscious for at least 15 minutes, any longer and I would have been in a lot more trouble. I remember trying to do a bump of heroin, without any fentanyl cut in it, after a few days of sober recovery from the incident and having a subsequent panic attack. Apparently my body didn't care for the heroin anymore, I had developed a physical reaction to the opiate from overdosing on the fentanyl the week before. I felt mad that this transformation of attitude had taken place and that my body couldn't get high anymore followed quickly by the feeling of shame, how did I turn into this monster so quickly?",752,0.0,0,0.0
1351,addiction,2020/03/28,"Some embarassing things happened... I am a weed addict and last night I definitely took things too far, and it's scared the shit out of me.

I was drinking with my flatmates (lockdown forced us together, so we aren't close or anything) and sometimes mix alcohol and weed, so knew what to expect. 

I decided to go for a smoke. Nothing out of the ordinary, felt a bit spinny but was fine to go back and join the party.

I passed the fuck out. 

I got to my chair, decided to call it after about 10 mins, stood up, got a huge headrush and just totally whited out. The worst part is that my eyes remained open and I was paralyzed, it was like I was stuck inside my body. 

I could hear them shouting and I knew I hit my head on the table, and that I had managed to sit back down...but I just couldn't move. I was absolutely mortified. 

I also knew I convulsed a bit. So my eyes were wide open, I was convulsing and I thwacked my head into the table in front of people I barely knew. 

I think I did the best thing by sitting down and trying to minimise the injury, but the fact it even happened is awful. One of them smokes too so it's not exactly taboo in the house, but we all decided to hang out because we are in lockdown and things are shit. 

They were so good about it and have been caring, but I ruined the party and worried them with my demonic shaking, eyes open, possessed behaviour.

My self destructive relationship with weed aside, I'm really struggling to unpack all of the embarrassment and the sensation of being paralyzed. It's never happened before but I know I just had a white out, and I'm totally fine head injury wise.

I can't really talk to anyone I know about this but any advice or support you can offer would be gladly accepted, but please go gently with me. I feel really messed up about it still.

Oh addiction. How much I want to say to you. You are a true narcissist. You poke and poke and poke at a persons weakest vulnerabilities until they snap and then you turn and blame them for it. It's textbook. You are the true satan. You promise happiness, power, escape, a break from reality but you don't specify the terms of agreement. You go back on your word and take more than you give. And you have no boundaries. You will continue doing this until death if you need to. But you'd prefer to keep them alive so that they can continue to serve you. So that you have a physical body to occupy, a physical presence on this Earth as the evil that you are. You care only for yourself, you will steal, lie, murder, commit any sin to get even a little of what you want. If you had your way, you'd take an entire life in the blink of an eye for a few hours of altered reality. And you have the perfect cover because it is the person that you occupy who makes these choices. Who does your bidding. To the rest of the world it looks like it is them who is damaged. In a way it is. But it is you who is the real culprit. You come in and change minds - literally. You change brains. Thought patterns. You change what people want. You take away their loved ones, their life savings, their morality, themselves and you have them trade it in for a substance. You don't even care what substance it is, whatever works for that person as long as they give in to you.    


You prey on those who have little or nothing left to lose but you also prey on those who have everything. Just manipulate the ego whichever way it was leaning to push a person out of themselves and into your cold, empty void. You are evil incarnate: you are all the deadly sins and more wrapped up in the most appeasing package for an animal. Pleasure. Short sighted pleasure. Physical, pure happiness and pleasure. What's really sad is that you are also a con man. The happiness you promise is actually that of the person but you concentrate it into a short period of time and take that plus interest from the future. You do not even create your own goodness, you steal that goodness from your host and you rob them of it. You are the mirror that shows each person their own unique darkness and light. Captivating, memorizing, like the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

Before you go thinking too highly of yourself and all of the lives you've claimed, know that you are in fact weak. A parasite. You are a clinging emotion that lives nowhere but in imagination and unmanifest potential. Your only accomplishment is to become manifest with the permission of us, the manifest who operate in this world. You are a predator so you will always find some kind of prey but you are not altogether that hard to defeat. All it takes to defeat you is a simple ""no"". You can't actually force yourself upon someone without their permission. You are a psychological and physical phenomenon brought about only with the permission of others. You are not real and you never will be. The craving for you may feel real but with time it dies back into nothingness. And people do defeat you. They do choose their families and loved ones and jobs and lives over you. With the self you can be combated. Centering in the self and the true nature of reality renders you powerless. Once one comes into themselves, you are seen as the pathetic shriveled thing that you are. Nothing but greed and desire and denial.   


I won't live with you. You've taken enough from me. I won't live with you if you inhabit the form of someone I love, I won't live with you if you try to inhabit me. I will always crush you. I am past your excuses, I am out of patience for your games. I have too much to gain and too much to lose to let you take my time, money, and personality. You went too hard on others and turned me off. So thank you for saving me from you. That probably has to be your biggest weakness. Once your morph into your full and final form you turn all of those around you away from you because you finally reveal the true monster that you are. I know how to deal with you. All I have to do is put my foot down and you will not touch me. I will leave behind every single thing I know in this life and start over before I listen to you ever again. This is one soul you won't destroy. This is one person who will stand up to you. I will stand up to you in all of your forms and varieties. I know what you look like even in your sneakiest moments. I am looking for you and I am bigger than you. You should be afraid of me because I am not afraid of you. I am proof that all you have to do is turn around and chase the chaser and \*poof\* you go up in smoke. I will turn an entire family away from you. I will create a safe haven without you. I will debilitate you and suffocate you. And I'll do it with a smile.

Addiction, get lost. You are dead to me. I have out smarted you. You are done here. With the power of God I am extracted from your grip and given back to myself. You have no power over me, I'm not even a victim of you. You aren't even big enough to victimize me. I will stop at nothing to keep you out of my life and my loved ones (if I can help it).

Back then I would drink until I blacked out and smoke weed to get twisted. Next morning I’d take a line of some addy. I never did Xanax because I didn’t see the point and knew how messed up it could be. 

After my break I had to recover. I did stuff once in a while but mainly I just smoke weed everyday and cigarettes. I developed some disorder where now I can’t smoke weed or drink. It’s awful. So I went straight edge for about a year. 

Then I had dental issues. My whole jaw was swollen and I was in terrible pain. Someone offered me a perc and I took that so fast. That’s when I found out opiates still work when nothing else really does. Pretty soon I was taking them as often as I could and smoking cigarettes again. 

When that dried up I started taking scoops and scoops of kratom everyday. I got tired of feeling like shit and needing something to feel okay so I quit cigarettes a few weeks ago. The other day I stopped taking kratom. 

I feel the need in my chest. It’s like someone is pushing me. It’s hard to breathe. It’s not that bad relatively, but I just want to feel okay. I’m afraid I’m never gonna get there.

I've been dependant on heroin for multiple years with chunks of sobriety lasting 6-9 months each time. Most recently, I had been actively using for 6 months, unable to stop. Any time I'm active in my addiction, there has to be a serious intervention to be able to get me through the withdrawals (usually incarceration). But this time I saw an opportunity to get on a plane, leave everything behind, and move back with my parents so that's exactly what I did.

Being quarantined and out of a job, he’s started taking multiple pills of Xanax and mixing it up with copious amount of alcohol and weed (at least that’s what he tells me he’s taking ). This is the first time I’ve seen him relapse. 
He barely sleeps at night and it’s affecting my sleep schedule. I wake up to find him dosing off standing up, sometimes even on his knees just...falling asleep. It’s awful. His pupils are tiny and sometimes he gets a lazy eye. It’s so scary I’ve gotten nightmares. I’m so stressed, I barely eat. Some days he constantly throws up and all I can do it make sure he hydrates.
I’ve done everything ...Ive talked to him to tell him he has a problem and should seek help. I’ve yelled at him for going back to his old way. I’ve cried to him begging him to stop. Sometimes he agrees he has an addition and will do better. But he doesn’t. Sometimes he outright disagrees with me and gets irritated. I’ve tried being nice/supportive and at the same time... I’ve lost it too.
It’s been a week.

We’ve been together less than a year, but we’re really compatible with each other, and we have similar personalities. However, he relapsed in September, got it together and then relapsed again last night. I have struggled with pills and coke in the past (5ish years ago), but managed to stop. He has multiple addictions, but this time it was crack, meth, and IV opioids. I am stable in my job, continuing my education, and just generally have my shit together. He just recently got a job after months of unemployment due to his last relapse. During this time, I supported us financially, and he incurred debt (~$1000) under one of my accounts that I had to pay back on my own to keep my credit score as high as it is. He has paid me back a portion ($400), but keeps asking to borrow $20 here, $30 there, which adds up to around $800. He’s been through a lot personally, custody and exgf issues, which I was there for him during, always hoping it will get better and the relationship won’t be so one-sided. This time, I did my best to comfort him when he was coming down, but I honestly don’t know if I can keep doing this, because seeing him like this is breaking my heart. I keep waiting and waiting for it to get better, and it hasn’t, and I’m starting to lose hope. I’m not sure if it’s worth staying anymore.

I have been taking suboxone for close to 3-4 years.

    I’ve heard about vivitrol, and I think I need to take this time I don’t have to work to stop taking suboxone long enough that they will give me the vivitrol shot. That week is gonna suck, but I think it will help me feel less like I’m still a drug addict, and I’ll be able to apply to jobs that drug test or even join the military (which I have considered often, as a way to go back to school for free and give me structure and a new social group and way of life that will benefit me). 

    I have a criminology degree (I graduated in December 2018) but I haven’t even tried to apply anywhere in related fields because I still feel like I’m not good enough, and I know that drug tests will be required, and often suboxone is one of the drugs they test for. I also want to go back to school for something different, I feel like criminology was a poor choice I made because I didn’t know what I was doing when I started college at 18. It’s not the degree that I would choose now, and most of the jobs i could get with that degree don’t appeal to me.

1374,addiction,2020/03/29,"What’s the end goal for a person with multiple addictions/addictive personality? Throughout my adolescent life I’ve always been addicted to at least a number of destructive habits. To name a few it’s been video games, smoking cigarettes, party drugs, alcohol and gambling (the last two being the worst, but I’ve got many more bad habits). My only question is, how does a person of this nature get free from these addictive traits and simply become what one would imagine as “normal”. 

Because I’ve tried many times at quitting one or more of these habits and simply find another addiction taking it’s place and becoming more dominant. Then theres the argument thinking I can take things in moderation, leading to hard relapses and the eventual full circle (myself simply taking part in all my addictions, to a certain degree). 

I’ve read several books on battling addiction but I can’t imagine a person with a dominant addictive personality just somehow cutting all ties and becoming totally sober. I truly believe there’s people like myself that just are consumed and addicted by several different things/habits. 

So back to my title, is the end goal just simply becoming sober from all these habits? Because moderation simply doesn’t work and if I dedicate myself to being completely sober, what else is there left to enjoy? I just don’t see how complete sobriety beats this, and from my experience moderation does not work either.

Late November 2019-January 26th 2020
-I noticed my husband had been acting different. He was here, but he didn’t seem really “here”, if you know what I mean. He wasn’t eating, he couldn’t perform during sex. He kept “falling asleep” at his mom’s house. I kept asking him what was wrong because we kept getting into arguments and that wasn’t normal for us. I kept begging him to tell me what was wrong because I knew he wasn’t being normal. He kept telling me I was manifesting things inside of my head. The whole week of Christmas we kept fighting because he kept disappearing at night. Christmas Day was a disaster because the fight we had gotten into was terrible and he was so ready to leave me.

January 26th, 2020
-It’s our 4th anniversary. I wake up and he’s not home. A couple hours later he shows up with gifts. Tells me that he’s going to go with his sister to the store because he needed to replace a part on her car. He told me to hang tight because he’d only be gone a couple hours. So I’m waiting and hours pass by. I’ve been calling him and texting him wondering where he was. It’s 5pm, then 6pm, then it’s 9pm. I’m angry and hurt at this point. I called his sister and she said he had left hours ago, around 2pm that day. She goes out to look for him and finds him laying down on the picnic table behinds his moms house. She said that he was sweating a lot, and his eyes were weird.

He finally comes home and tells me that he’s been addicted to molly. I get the feeling he’s lying so I keep pressuring him and he admits that he’s been using meth for almost 2 months. He stops using it and fast forward to the past couple days. He’s been acting strange, I noticed he hasn’t been sleeping for the past 2 days. Yesterday he went to go “vacuum” the car for 3 hours? When he came home he was sweating a lot. Even inside the house. It’s cold in our house and he was sweating. He was acting funny too. How can I deal with this?

1379,addiction,2020/03/30,"How much pressure is too much pressure to get back to normal after my SO relapsed? My SO had a relapse after over 2 years clean.  Once on a friday, another last Tuesday.  Thankfully, I was home sick last week (not with Covid-19), so it was easy for me to be active in helping create deterrents (ensuring he didn't have cash on him, keeping him company, etc) and help with taking it one day at a time (making sure he kept his \[virtual\] therapy appointment, making myself available and supportive to conversation, etc).  


He has spent the past week basically asleep and low energy.  I know he feels a lot of shame and guilt and is likely in a depressive episode.  He already has issues that go untreated like Asperger's and ADD that he has to struggle with when not detoxing.    


I'm not sure how much I should push on him to get back to ""normal"".  He usually does most of the cooking, cleaning, dog care, etc as I make more money.  On top of that, his job is closed due to the virus where I am still at work, so he has literally all day to do whatever, which I know is more of a curse than a blessing.  Being that only 2 other people work in my office, I'm still going to my desk, so I'm not at home.  


He has been doing very little of the daily routine stuff that is his ""job"".  The first few days I understood as he detoxed.  The next few days I let slide because I'm trying to be understanding.  But I just popped back home and he's taking a nap after only being awake for a few hours.  In my head, I think he should be getting ""back to it"", but I don't want to apply stress that could lead to a relapse.  At the same time, I don't want to let things slide like just because he relapsed, he's allowed to dip out of the responsibilities of life while his body heals.

I never thought it was humanly possible to love someone so damn much, but sometimes I wonder whether it’s love or obsession.

I’m not even the addict.. and I’m crushed. We all struggle with it, we all hurt, and we all feel the pain and heartache it brings upon all of us. 

The anxiety it brings, it engulfs me. Every time he walks out the door I wonder if he will come back. Every time he has money in his hands I wonder where it will go.

He is on a number of prescription medications, and has been on many over the years, I can't even begin to name them all but mostly related to depression, anxiety, sleep aids. I was surprised recently to learn he is now on lithium as well.

He abuses these drugs. He mixes and matches them, he overdoses on them. When his doctor won't prescribe he'll just buy them from other countries and abuse them. The drugs make him like a zombie. He's had one incident after another where he's passed out in public or crashed his car due to driving in a complete haze, he comes to and can't even remember how he got there.

He's had therapists, psychiatrists, he's been to a short-term in-treatment facility. I don't know what's next. I really worry about his survival, he's endangered his life many times (unclear if intentional or not) and is clearly on this destructive path.

I am terrified of the person I have become and I am trying so hard to change my thought process and the addictions I have become aware with. 

I am not sure where to start but I had a very bad acid trip when I was living on my own at 19. I never used any drugs really before then other then smoking weed. After that trip my life went into a downward spiral and I moved home with my parents and was prescribed klonopin for anxiety and sleep. I started off at 1.5mg and currently on .375 and having trouble getting off them and it seems my mind is trying to escape reality all the time and everything feels fake. Along with the benzos Ive had trouble kicking this habit of taking hydros a couple times a month for the last few years coupled with a weekend binge drinking problem that has got me in trouble more than once. I have days where I feel better than others but those are the days I seem to think it is ok to drink or party with my friends or how I think of it is ""keeping up with them.""

More then anything I just want to feel like I did before any of the drugs Ive done and the guilt is eating me alive. It seems time is just passing by and I regret so much and who Ive become and just want to be better. I have been in therapy but it seems like I am not doing enough to change and I want to so bad.

I became stable so i went to college for a year, I'm still using so i landed a couple grand in debt in student loans, which i used to buy drugs.

1400,addiction,2020/03/31,"Quitting Cocaine – Some Questions Hey there. I'm hoping some of you that are further along might help me out with a lot of doubts I have.

My boyfriend is trying to quit cocaine, which he's been doing on a rather regular basis for about the last year and a half. The last three months have been really bad. He's been taking some practically every day, with some breaks of one of maximum two days in between. I wasn't around for about a month and he's only now started to open up about how big the addiction is. After I 'caught' him doing some last Thursday, he came to the conclusion that only big measures would have an effect. He factory reseted his phone to get rid of the phone numbers that were on it (you can't delete them). I now have sole access to his Google Account, again because you can't delete contacts without there being an option of recovering them. With the lockdowns in place, getting anything without a number is going to be difficult; we're also always around each other.

He's four days in and feeling absolutely terrible with intense cravings. Now he's thinking that quitting cold turkey is impossible, also because he's not feeling on top of stuff with work because he is feeling so restless and can't focus. He thinks that easing off cocaine would be better, with larger gaps of time in between – essentially getting some tonight after four days, then some next week after a break of seven etc. It sounds to me like he has intense cravings and desperately wants it, regardless of what would be best, but I've got no experience in it. The only drug I've ever done is MDMA, so it is difficult to relate to how he is feeling.

1. Is easing off the drug better than going cold turkey? I imagine it takes much more self-control.
2. Another idea that came up is taking MDMA on the weekend (we have some left) to take his thoughts off coke when he's feeling particularly antsy. He heard it can help with quitting cocaine as well. He's never had any addiction problems with MDMA, but I fear that taking any type of drug might make him want to take another as well. I'm also personally not too keen on taking it now (would have preferred to wait another three months or so), but I'd be into it if it could be of help. He also came up with that idea before feeling miserable and is now less interested in it, so I'm inclined to think that it's more than just an idea born from a craving.
3. To the people that have supported a partner or friend during cocaine recovery, is there anything at all you did that helped? I get that there is nothing that will truly get his mind off it on withdrawal, but aside from giving him a massage or a hug or whatever, I'm feeling very powerless and it breaks my heart to see him like that.",532,1.0,1,0.0018796992481203006

1405,addiction,2020/03/31,"I feel myself losing control *Trigger Warning”!!!!
I will be discussing self harm and my current problems with substance abuse. I don’t even really know why I’m writing this but I’ve been wanting to get it off my chest for a while I find this as a safe place to vent. 

Like the title says, I could feel myself losing control. I’ve always been really cautious of drinking and enjoying certain substances for years. But I had it so under control over everything in my life and was so scared that something was gonna happen and I could make a big mistake. I never had sex without being on birth control and never used protection, I never used anything unless I was with my older sister and she said it was okay and she got it for me from someone she trusted, and even then I would do such a tiny bit. I was always pretty proud of myself for being responsible (maybe too responsible and really just scared to try new things). But a few months ago, my boyfriend met someone who was hooking him up with all sorts of stuff and I totally took advantage of that. He held on to it so I could only do it on the weekends and as son as we ran out I made him go pick up more literally like it was emergency. Blew through almost $300 in about a week and maybe a day or two. And right after I ran out, I went on a trip with my friends and I could tell that I was such a different person. I was mean and angry and frustrated and it’s all I talked about. My friends offered me other stuff but it just made me more mad cuz it wasn’t what I wanted. I threw a total tantrum like a little kid and I’m embarrassed to admit it but I must accept my wrongs. After rushing my boyfriend to get me more, I confided in my two best friends that I don’t have a problem but I can feel it getting that way. I would try and hold off on it all day but as soon as I started I couldn’t stop, and I’d be hitting lines like everything 30 minutes. Ironically, after I told my friends I was gonna slow down and of course I gave up on that the next day and was like “okay just a little bit” which turns into me taking me more every thirty minutes. Until I finally got to the point where it was night time and my whole body was so amped up and I told myself I shouldn’t do one more, but stupid me did it anyways. I knew it was one too much, I couldn’t breathe, if I looked at one thing or sat down I felt like I was gonna pass out. I went to my sister (which I felt bad would probably disappoint her on how irresponsible I was being) but she was patient and helped me through it. Obviously I didn’t have to go to the hospital, so I feel blessed that it didn’t get to that point. So maybe it wasn’t as dramatic as it felt to me, but I didn’t know what was going to happen so I was sure I was gonna have a heart attack or pass out. I was really scared and afraid that I might die. 

It’s just frustrating because I know I have always had an obsessive personality and I’ve always had problems with self harming. It feels like whatever way I try to cope with my mental issues, I get obsessed and over do it. I’ve been struggling with self harm actively for about 5 years, and sometimes did it when I was younger. It’s been several several years that it’s been constant and a few years before that it was really me just experimenting with it as a coping mechanism. But now I find myself turning to these substances or drinking or anything of that nature has really helped me with that problem and I’m proud to say I haven’t self harmed in month! (Wish I knew the exact date so I could celebrate lol). 
But my only problem with this is that I can tell over the few months I’ve gained these nasty habits that I feel like I need it, or I’ll be rude and impatient and just not the person I know I am, especially to all the people I love. I just feel like I’m losing control over everything and it’s not a problem yet but I can see a clear path of my way towards it. I’m not sure what to do. 

I also wanna apologize if any of the things I said triggered anybody, or if I’m making a big deal about nothing to cause attention, or am unclear about what this page is really supposed to be about. I’m new to this page and felt as though it was a safe place for me to open up, even if it’s ridiculous to complain compared to all the problems in the world. I’m just afraid I’m adding a negative stigma because a lot of people seem to be so positive on their recovery back to health and I wanna apologize if my message puts any bad feelings into anyone’s thoughts. 

Thank you so much for reading, it’s good to just get my thoughts out without being judged or yelled at. My love and prayer go out to every single person struggling with these issues and of course any body struggling with all the million problems in the world.

1408,addiction,2020/04/01,"What can I expect out of therapy? I've finally decided that this problem is beyond my control. I thought for the longest time that I could handle this but I can't. The little slip ups are all too easy and I always find a justification for them. I'm a poly addict. Main vices being kratom, alcohol, weed, and occasionally lortab. For well over a year now I've tried to go 1 month sober and have been unable. The longest I've made it was 2 weeks on 2 occasions. My addiction is not destroying my life. I am a functioning addict but it is preventing me from achieving goals and making progress. I keep a journal (main focus of which being my addiction) and have yearly, monthly, and weekly goals. They all take a back seat though. Getting my fix always comes first before anything else.

So I've been researching and contacting therapists for a week now looking to set something up. I basically need someone to open up to about this shit and hold me accountable for my actions. Another problem I have, despite knowing that my addictions hold me back, is not being ready to quit everything 100%. My family and friends drink during social occasions and I have no problems hanging out and having a few with them. My problem is when I'm at home drinking alone. Also kratom. It's great when I have a lot to get done or need a little boost because I'm tired or unmotivated. But then I start using it as a crutch and take it everyday. In the back of my mind I still feel like moderate use is an achievable goal. However from reading this sub it seems like moderation is not possible for most addicts. Or it takes a tremendous amount of discipline that I currently lack. I don't want to quit forever but at the same time I'm tired of this problem consuming me. I'm going to remain stagnant as long as catching a buzz is my number 1 priority. I want to get this one month under my belt but beyond that, I don't know. I should probably go longer just can't fathom it.

1 year smoking it and 2 years IV. 

I managed to clean my self up on my own for 3 months, 
then relapsed and used for another year almost daily.

Trying to keep a long story short so somebody might take the time to read this. I won't get into every detail, this is the first time I've posted in these groups but I really need help. 

I got to a stage of shooting upto 10 times a day, I worn my body out so much and messed myself up to the point I was sick when needing to use, then sick from using. I couldn't get out of bed, mentally &amp; physically I had no limit with it. Every day, all day, barley any breaks or rest in 3 years! I don't know how I survived it.

After getting to that point I made the decision to be admitted in an inpatient withdrawal detox unit.
While being on the waiting list my GP told me in the mean time I didn't have an option for my withdrawals other than to use if I really need to and try to go back to smoking it. My arms, hands were that badly scared. 

I lasted 4 days and self discharged, relapsed straight as I left and used for another 3 months. During that time I was seeing a therapist weekly, managed to get myself through a deathly detox at home and stayed clean for a month. 

I got through a month and I knew I couldn't handle going back through it all again. I left my state and enrolled into a 12 month residential program at one of the top listed strictest rehabs. It was too intense and didn't feel like the right program for me. I did 1 month there then came back home on another waiting list, 2 months have gone by now..

I made it to the 3 month mark, till I relapsed 2 days ago. I can't get any further than that, it's a cycle I can not break and I have so much support in my life.. I'm too scared to tell anyone because I will lose everything again. I'm even ashamed to tell my therapist. I don't know whether these 2 days on it are going to turn into another 2 years.

Even at 3 months clean I feel as bad as day 1. Even if I'm sick to death, underweight, broke, lying to the ones I love.. that's my normal. Clean/sober is impossible for me because of how madly this stuff has taken over me. 

If anyone might have advice on what my next step should be.. I really need a plan for the moment. I'm on the waiting list for a 10 week residential program but I'm doubting and lost hope that it will even be enough to help me. No idea how long it's going to take.

We all are masking underlying issues with something, my problem is I have blocked everything so far out. I have no memories just still feel pain. 
PTSD/depression..Abusive relationship which started when my addiction to meth did.

The way I was raised, the family and lifestyle I have I was the type of person who never should have ended up on this side of the fence..

My partner was dealing but never used in his life, he stopped that lifestyle but Im still left behind stuck in that world alone. 

I'm still young. I can't live like this or it's going to kill me. I just don't see a way out when I have tried everything.

Prescribed Seroquel 100mg, melatonin 2mg and Deptrum 25mg
at night. It just gets me to sleep then I wake up dead inside. 

I don't think I am able to admit to myself or even process I've relapsed again.. I can't believe I did it after how much I tried to get there. And after everything I put myself and family through. 

I wonder if this just the way I am going to be forever? But this time I can't drag anybody down with me through it. People have done so much to help me. I feel like I would rather suffer through it alone than pass on the pain of disappointment over &amp; over again. Why did I ever do it to myself?",772,1.0,1,0.0012953367875647669

I want forced to stop taking it, no one asked me to or even suggested it, but I woke up one morning shortly after my job shutting down due to Covid 19 that as shitty as things are in the world right now, maybe it's the only time where I won't be living a cycle that I've been stuck in for quite a while of buying something, whether that be opiates or suboxone or methadone or Xanax just so I can be well enough to go to work to make money to buy more drugs so I can go to work to make money, you get the point.

I've thought a lot these past few days, but mostly been insanely surprised at how mild the withdrawal symptoms are, when I've gone through withdrawals plenty of times, from less than what I've been taking and being fine with for months now. I've decided there are more than likely a couple of reasons for that. Reason 1) this is the first time I've truly decided on my own that it was time to do this instead of having the loss of my children as the main driving factor, unfortunately, that was enough to get me clean, not enough to keep me clean (I honestly can't say I'll stay clean this time, I'm just saying the withdrawal is different) 2) Its also the first time I've decided to get clean that I'm not sitting in a government housing apartment surrounded by all of my drug addicted friends doing and/or selling my DOC and I'm actually at a pretty good place mentally and physically.

I do think having a pretty long moment of not having to worry about work helps too, I just thought it was a really good time. I'm not saying it's been a walk in the park and I feel great three days in, I'm just saying it's better than past withdrawals have been for me.

1415,addiction,2020/04/01,"Broken  When I was a kid, like most, I had a favorite toy. I had a   model Bobby Labonte, green, Interstate Battery, NASCAR. I was never a big fan of NASCAR, but my dad was and he bought me that car, along with others alike. But that one was my favorite. One day I decided to build a ramp on my kitchen floor right in front of the steps leading to the basement. I rolled the car as fast as I could across the floor, and off the ramp it went. It flew down the stairs crashing hard into the cement basement floor. Like today I didn’t think about the repercussions of my actions, It never once crossed my mind that this would destroy the car. I just simply wanted to do it. And that was all the convincing I have ever needed to do anything in my life. I have always put very little thought into the consequences of my actions. When I saw the wheels fly of the car, I knew I had broken my favorite toy. At first I thought maybe I’ll be able to just pop them back on. But when I took a closer look, I saw the plastic was broken. Meaning there was no fixing it. My stomach dropped and I ran to my dad in hopes of him buying me a new one. He  told me he wouldn’t and that I needed to start thinking before I acted. I was devastated I had this hopeless feeling like it was broken forever and I’d never get it back. That feeling is so familiar now. I constantly feel like I’ve broken myself and there is no amount of begging or manipulating or tinkering that would fix my broken brain. It just always seems so impossible, to get myself to be happy again, to be free of this giant gorilla on my back weighing me down. Addiction is something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemies. It is  truly crippling. And I don’t know what to do....I want to be free but the hill to climb just seems so very impossible. 

Im not sure what is compelling me to start a reddit account and write this to the world. Maybe I’m just desperate. Desperate to hear that one piece of advise that will click, that will change my perspective and give me the power to finally rod myself of addiction.

1416,addiction,2020/04/01,"Helping Others (Long Post) Possibly Part 1 Hey, world of Reddit,

I have long had the idea in my head to write a blog about my problems with addiction, and how in the end I managed to overcome them. Since I was not entirely sure of how to go about this and with my end goal of getting some things off my chest and helping others I thought this would be a good place to start.

It all started with alcohol, I wish I could tell 23 years old me how much alcohol would be a gateway to the next almost 8 years of my life and how it would begin a struggle and personal battle which at some points I was not even sure I was involved in. 

Some background I had recently moved country (Germany to spain) and found myself living in a new culture as a scuba instructor one which involved hanging out with our students every day after work and as the Spanish do drinking a lot of beers, 1 beer a day soon turned into 4 and then 6. But everything was fine right?. I remember once counting and it was 120+ days in a row I had drunk 4 or more beers. Did i realize i had a problem **no.**

From there, things started to escalate I started taking what I considered to be party drugs and I suppose believed that this was not really a problem, everyone else in the club taking ecstasy and cocaine somehow validated my actions and made them explainable to myself.

This then leads to a three-year slippery downslope were my once a month party night became tri-weekly and eventually getting to the lowest 6 months of my life at which point I dread to think the number of weeks that passed when I was taking 6 - 10g of cocaine per week and most worryingly working as normal pretending everything was okay and being able to function whilst heavily sleep deprived and under the effects of all of these drugs.

To free myself from my own personal hell I ended my relationship of 3 years, changed my entire friendship group and tried to get professional help. In the end, I quit my job and moved to a completely different part of the country.

I'm now 8 months clean, and somehow feel like I'm on the road to recovery. I'm happy to answer any questions anyone has and hope someone reading this might find it helpful in someway.",425,0.0,0,0.0

1425,addiction,2020/04/01,"Internet and Social Media Addiction In the recent months, I've begun developing the thought that I may be addicted to the internet, specifically social media. My new phone has the ability to track and display my screen time and how much is associated with which app, and I noticed that my daily screen time is around 2-6 hours. Not only that, but I usually have a feeling of disappointment in myself after having a long spout of scrolling through Reddit or watching YouTube or Twitch (a live-streaming website) videos for an hour or two. Additionally, I started to notice that I have urges to just sit down and go on these sites.

Most recently, I thought to myself, this may be an actual problem. Whenever I've brought it up to people in the past, like my parents, I usually get responses like ""It's okay to relax and decompress every now and then."" and ""You're too hard on yourself."" For a while, I believed those things because they have some backing. I am hard on myself at times, I work very hard, and I tend to set high standards and expectations for myself. However, what's making me question that reasoning now are the signs I mentioned in the previous paragraph. I don't think the screen time I take up, the feelings of self-disappointment, and the urges are simply due to me not relaxing. In fact, I think that I’ve been going on the internet as an unhealthy way to ""relax.""

For years, I've always felt bad about myself when I spend time on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit, and I've always had this vision in my head of a life in which I don’t use these things for entertainment. Instead, I’ve always wanted to be able to find the same levels of happiness and relaxation by doing things that are productive (exercise, meditation, playing an instrument, doing work, reading, etc.). I understand that it is possible to use social media in moderation and that many people do it, but it is very difficult for me. I can lose track of time while on these sites/apps. Maybe I do hold very high standards for myself, but my gut is telling me this is an issue. I’ve been feeling this way so much recently that I decided to take an entire week off of the sites/apps I’ve identified as being addicted to, cold turkey. It’s been a couple days, and it’s pretty difficult. I’ve been feeling a lot more anxious than usual (I’ve always had anxiety, but not at this level since I was in college.), and I’m beginning to question my methodology. That's ultimately what brings me here to this subreddit, a question I've had on my mind for a while now: **Can the internet and social media be considered a legitimate addiction, and should I treat it as such? I know there are methodologies for treating addictions, and I’m wondering how applicable they can be to what I am trying to change about myself with my internet use.** Social media addiction is rarely mentioned as much as drug addiction, and I feel like so many of us are just sweeping its existence under the rug because of how common and novel it is. I understand that drugs are very different from social media in the sense that the internet is a tool common to everyone that can be used for productive activities, whereas that’s not the case for most hard drugs that people struggle with (plus hard drugs can have much more severe effects on someone in a shorter amount of time). That being the case, it’s not easy to find legitimate, scientifically backed resources on how to work through something like this.

So what do you all think? What’s your opinion on this? Is anyone experiencing something similar? Are there any good resources I can check out to help guide me? The idea of treating this as a legitimate addiction is new to me, so I’m still trying to wrap my head around it and figure out where I go from here.",713,0.0,0,0.0

After finding our small, but growing household savings/quarantine safety net wiped out, I confronted my spouse who continuously denied knowing about it until finally telling me that he spent it on drugs, specifically dabs and coke.  We have had many issues over the years with him keeping drug use behind my back.  A few months back I found out that our rent was 2 months behind, after having believed he had paid it.  He said then that he had actually spent it at the casino and on weed.  I am hesitant to believe that any was spent at the casino, not that it really even matters.  I told him I didn’t want him spending money without me knowing about it, and I had asked him to stop smoking weed, as this had been a financial and dependency issue for many years.  He had kept coke use from me for over a year before I finally found his (empty) stash of it and called him out, to which he admitted using it, but that it had been “only a couple times”.  Recently, I had been suspecting he was using again, and I asked him, telling him I that I didn’t want to fight, but that I wanted to help him, and he told me I had nothing to worry about, that he wasn’t using, but appreciated the sentiment.  He said the words “I hope you don’t think I’m a drug addict or something.”  Well today I found out that he spent over a thousand dollars over the last few months and he finally admitted that he’s got an addiction problem.

A lot of this post I guess is just me venting, but I have some questions too.  How can I move past this, how can I learn to trust him again, while he tries to get better?  The denial and lies stretch out weeks and months before I finally get him to tell me the truth, by which point things are much deeper than they had initially been.  How do I trust that he is actually putting in effort to overcome this?  He expressed that he never pictured that he would be in this position, and that he’s not proud of it, and I believe all of that, but how can I trust that he won’t hide this from me again?  I’ve been supportive of him from the beginning to the point that I feel like I’m just being used now.  I don’t feel that he respects me.  I love him and we have a life together, kids together, and I know life could be so much better.  I don’t want to leave him, but this is taking such a massive toll on my mental health, and I am feeling so overwhelmed with it all, that I sometimes feel like my only chance at any sense of normalcy is leaving.

The counselor told me also even though I know nothing is going to change between me and the dancer my body is react differently. She said it's because a bond is forming between me and her which isnt a bad thing but the way my body is reacting is bad.

1445,addiction,2020/04/02,"High School and Alcohol I was 17. Had a beautiful girlfriend, a good minimum wage job, hobbies, and good grades. I took a liking to drinking. It started off as a reward to finishing homework, but it steadily advanced into me drinking excessively atleast a few times a week. Almost always alone. 

There’d be times I would show up to school after a whole night of binge drinking, tired and tipsy. My tolerance was strong enough where I’d be good to go by 6am. It was a regular thing. It’s where my weekends went, it’s why I wanted to see my girlfriend less, it’s why I fell into a depression. I was too young to realize how much of a problem it was and blamed on everything else, including my relationship. One night while I was drunk, I cheated on my girlfriend with a close friend. I thought it’d make me feel better; it’d cure my depression, but it didn’t. It went on for about a month until eventually she found out. I got jumped by 3 other grown ass men the same day. Can’t even say I blamed them. 

That was a wake up call for me. And the start of a very difficult heartbreak. I stopped drinking that day. Without constantly numbing myself I realized I loved that girl, and that I took her for granted. I also realized I lost a good friend who genuinely cared for me. The break up was drawn out for months, and it destroyed me. I lost my job, I lost some friends, and I lost my girlfriend. To this day, she doesn’t know the problems I went through with alcohol because I didn’t talk about it. To her, I was perfectly fine during my binging. Just distant.

I am 267 days clean now. I was in a recovery house for two and a half months, then went to treatment for three months, and came back to the recovery house at Christmas 2019.
I was supposed to move out of the recovery house close to the end of next April 2020 because they only give a person six months to stay here and that will be up. 
But the Covid-19 pandemic has kept the house under fairly strict isolation rules, and I'm grateful for them. I have been looking for work and an apartment or room to rent, but the isolation situation has made that more difficult than ever. They have given me an assurance that I won't be kicked out without anywhere to go.

This quarantine can be a very constructive period of reflection for addicts to inventory their patterns and challenge them selves. Yet somewhat on the contrary this period of time can remind us of feelings of loneliness and powerlessness we felt when we faced our addictions alone and without the support of a healthy community. How somebody would perceive the quarantine may not be the same as another’s. For me, I’m home with my parents and brother and I take online zoom courses. Being in my old room has been challenging yet offered a beneficial opportunity. To reflect on my childhood and l have manifested that.

Ive got this whole other post in relationship\_advice bc theres the possibility we could be more than friends, but, thats not really the point.

He's always drank some and smoked weed some, I dont know if this is the place to say it, but Ive do the same occasionally and never really saw it as a problem. 

A few weeks ago he did MDMA for the first time and really had a great time. He also was like, the drug isnt addictive because you cant take it more than every few weeks. 

Well he just went through A LOT of stuff. Anniversary of his sisters death, his dad is in the hospital possibly dying, had to go back to his home he was heavily abused in because his sr semester of college was cancelled thanks to coronavirus, isnt optimistic about finding a job in the current economy to be able to escape that house soon, his car just died....

Anyway when he got back into town, he bought more MDMA. He was like, Im gonna do it again because it was a few weeks ago. I figure, ok, whatever, have a great time. Well he bought LSD too and did that two days in a row, prior to the day he did MDMA. He didnt take a lot though so he wasnt like, hallucinating. Anyway yesterday he basically rolled out of bed and took MDMA a second day in a row and then added LSD to it.I guess this is a common thing, but dangerous? Then while we were facetiming he started doing shots of vodka.

But I was like OK this is just gonna worsen your depression. Like, maybe dont keep doing this? And he was like, no I know me Ill keep taking MDMA until I run out. So I was like...alright well, at least then youll be out and even if the hangover/depression lasts like a couple weeks...youll get through it.

Except now he's talking about buying more MDMA. I know its one of those things like, I cant help, he has to help himself or whatever. And maybe the person I thought I knew isnt him since clearly we havent known eachother a long time. But he really, -really- was doing a lot better when we met. He had been away from home for 2 years, and graduating with high honors/deans list/top of his class.

&amp;#x200B;

The good old AA members kept blocking me and kicking me out of the zoom online meetings.

Mostly because I put forward positions and information that the brain-washed cannot deal with...

Liek the stats on the AA relapse rate, the churn rate were 50% of newcomers are gone within 3 months and at the end of every year there are only 5% of the newcomers left..... 

When you ask, ""Why does AA have such a stupendous failure rate? And what are you people in the groups and service structure doing to promote the ""unpalatability"" of the membership of AA, and to reverse it?

They have no answers.

Warfare breaks out.  So with my 43 years of being around AA - I am no push over to the bullshit and I will and do hammer these people when they try it on.  ""We serve up our clubby crap to him and expect to get away with it, and he wipes the floor with everyone in the group. Tsk, Tsk, Tsk - we have better boot him from the online meetings"".

So I launch this into their chat rooms.

&amp;#x200B;

The AA failure rate - how much of this is due to AA being the worst performing of all treatments (George Valiant - AA trustee conducted university trials - look them up) and people just not willing to put in the effort to deal with ALL their issues - not just alcohol?

For every 10,000 welcome to NA / AA chips are bought by the groups, only ONE 20 years drug free medallion is bought. What happened to the the other 9,999 people? I did the global research on the issue 10 years ago, and had it published here. [https://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effectiveness.html](https://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effectiveness.html) If you don't believe me, ask your area / national office for their sales figures.

Of course the dickheads in this meeting will screech ""You can't say that"" - ""Well I can, and I have, and what I say is true. It's been 41 years, 10 months and 17 days since I made the decision to stop using. And all the vitriolic fuckwits that will denounce me and kick me from the group - You are the ones, who are going to become the ones, who are going to die using. LOL - Your the 9,999, out of the 10,000 who were not prepared to do what it takes to get to 20 years drug free.

""Oh boot him! boot him from the meeting"".... they screech.

Well the intolerance of people who convey information based upon fact, and the unwillingness to make the most of the opportunity when it comes your way, AND the unwillingness to do anything other than talk shit instead of putting in the hard work - that's where the 9,999 relapsers out of the 10,000 come from.

In all my years, NOT one of you ever have the humility and scincerity to ask, ""What do I have to do, to stay drug free, deal with all my issues, one day at a time, for the rest of my life?"" - To me, almost all of the people here, are just talkers of shit.  The clubby, crawly, incrowd....

Gods special education team - totally intolerant of any opinion, other than their own.

Get on the phone, and ask your regional offices for a copy of their medallion sales figures for the last 10 years....

It's not the absolute accuracy that is the issue, it's the gaping chasm between 10,000 welcome to AA / NA keytags, being sold to the groups, for every ONE 20 years drug free medallion....

So for everyone of me, there are like 100,000 who have sailed themselves into the garbage bins of life.....

To me, your loser retarded opinons, do not count for anything.

The majority of people in AA freely give me their disapproval....

Haaaaaaaa Haaaaaaa Haaaaaa The majority of the Gossiping, Retarded Arsehole, LOSERS in AA relapse......

You bring your relapses upon yourselves and your bring it upon each other....

AA is in serious decline... I saw the trustees report that they alluded to the fact that because the insurance companies are no longer paying for the rehab revolving doors, not enough fresh members are being recruited by the AA cultists, to make up for the churn rate and relapse rate of AA, and without enough unpaid workers to make all the literature sales to the newcomers, who then do not become more unpaid workers, AA is facing insolvency.

Why do I sit in self pity when I’m the one mentally making the decision to physically pop the pill.  Then I act like I’m unaware it might cause problems.

I have just got of 12mg a day of suboxone 28 days ago and I did not wean down. I started taking Kratom because I heard it helped the withdrawals. It did not seem to help at all for the first 5–6 days and then all of a sudden it started helping. About a week ago I started noticing I was getting aggravated more easily and now I’m feeling depressed and have no motivation and feel lethargic a lot and I don’t know if maybe the Kratom is now causing this somehow or if it could be the paws from suboxone still coming through. Not knowing is the worst. As my tolerance has increased I’ve been taking 25g a day of Kratom split into 5 even doses. I plan on getting off that starting next weekend as well. If anyone has any insight to what I may be experiencing I’d greatly appreciate it. Besides this I have no experience with Kratom.,194,0.0,0,0.0

1478,addiction,2020/04/04,"CORONAVIRUS IN MY WORLD OF AN ADDICTIVE PERSONALITY. Hi guys, this post is just vent a little, whine a little and to explain the good experience and bad experiences.

So it's been 12 days of lock down in england but  about 21 day isolation for me as my work had grinded to a halt. I'm a self employed roofer/labourer/builder and all of my jobs that were lined up have been put on hold until we shake this thing.

During the time at home with my partner, it's been hard because of the lack of money, the repeat in daily activities and the lack of drugs I've had. 

I wasn't as much addicted to any recreational drugs and haven't been for a while but I still dabbled and after being forced to go without anything recreational for the last 17 days, I think I'm in a good place in which I know I don't  need them to get through a shitty day. The thing is, because everything was slowing down before the lockdown I was finding myself trying harder to fight the need for drugs out of boredom but failed often which left me in a particularly bad place with cash flow. 

The main problem I'm having is stupidly, I got myself addicted to codeine again which arent cheap otc medication and I've just ran out of those too so the next week is going to be a little tougher than usual. 

Other issues that are becoming a factor during this isolation...
I'm really starting to hate my house, I want to decorate so bad because it's so plain  and awful but I just dont have the funds.
I'm starting to get annoyed at my girlfriend for tiny things.
I hate our cats and I'm getting increasingly annoyed with them  I've even suggested getting rid of them to save money on cat food and to save my stress levels but she has had two of them for 6 years so she would only get rid of 2 and the other two are feral so they are pointless human haters who only pop their heads out every once in a while. 
I hate her rat she has, bo matter how much she she cleans the cage, I can still smell it.
I'm used to being out of the house constantly and driving everywhere but I csnt afford the fuel to drive around even for half an hour just to calm myself down.


Because of my mistakes earlier on I have now got £7 to my name and I'm screwed, thankfully I have plenty of food in and bills are paid for. I've just ran out of tobacco I have signed up to an agency who want to get me a job starting tomorrow but I'm still going to be struggling until I get some wages from them but it's a step forward at least.

Adding to this, my mother died 10 years ago and it's her birthday on April 14th, and this day is a day for myself to allow myself to either get very wild and drunk and reminiscent or go on an adventure or just do something on my own where I'm immune from judgement or punishment.

1480,addiction,2020/04/04,"Tips For Fetish Recovery? Hello everyone, I decided to also post my story in this subreddit because I think people here could help me. If you have time in your heart, would you guys and girls be willing to help me find creative solutions to fight off a sex adicition? Or at least, what is left of the addiction. I still battle hard every day.
This is the story:

I am autistic so it is a little bit hard to express my feelings,
Humor is very important and as a comedian I understand that we people use it all the time however this post is hard to do so I appreciate constructive comments please :)

I had a conversation with a professional sex counselor this week about eradicating my fetishes.

So I repress my sexuality a lot, and I think you will understand and even agree with me after reading a few examples from my list.

I can not accept my fetishism because I dont want to, here is why:

&amp;#x200B;

(Long Story Short)

When I was little I always liked to place things between my legs and somehow a vacuum cleaner hose (not the nozzle)

ended up there. I liked the feeling as a child and because of my ASD spectrum condition I got obsessed with

the feeling and hoses thus collected them in puberty.

The fetish finally developed in getting horny from vacuum cleaner sound, smell and just the hose in general the most.

When I was about 11 I was also on the internet a lot searching for vacuum videos and I stumbled upon ladies vacuuming

in high heels and I got a huge fetish for feet n certain high heels also.

Fetishes in itself and sex are things that I do not necessarily view as bad or negative at all, but I view them rationally.

I have not really found a use that is beneficial to me for years and that is somewhat tiring.

Here are some of the experiences I had in the past to give you all a context of what I am talking about:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Vacuum cleaner hoses are almost everywhere so the horny stimuli is too high for me if I dont fight it.

\-My thoughts were running wild thinking about sexy woman and how the inside of their vacuum hose would smell and al similar kind of stuff would make me ejaculate a little.

\-Even somtimes the dust was a turn on.

\-The fetish is also very precise, when some things arent right in setting I cant even get an erection (for example from a ridgeless vacuum hose, they are not sexy to me, or when the are animal hairs in or on the hose)

\-I had sex with a lot of vacuum hoses by cutting the nozzle off and exposing the inside and sticking my thing in (without the power on even), and yes they were not always clean and washed so imagine the hygiene

\-Almost thinking about sex intensely the whole day long and I was fapping so much that I felt the effect everytime, thus saw no gain in being so tired after ejaculating and its just not fun. 

I also did sex without ejaculating when I was in to spirituality (learned my lessons dont like the lifestyle)

\-Searching like a beast all the time for vacuuming women who make sexual videos on the internet and obsessing on that .

\-Once I had to borrow the vacuum cleaner of the neighbour lady here to clean the couch and I ejaculated premature because I got so horny from her vacuum cleaner ( I found her attractive also)

\-Emotionally draining because I feel like I am letting myself down.

After a big porn addiction that I managed to overcome in my teens, I just sat down with myself and really really thought about this fetish. 

I questioned if I genuinly enjoyed all this, but could feel it in my whole body just being a big no when I think rationally.

I dont want to be in to female feet and high heels arent so appealing to me when I am non-horny, I rather write poetry instead.

\-And more

&amp;#x200B;

I really noticed that I am more stubborn in what I want than other people, I really dislike how my sexuality is formed now,

But it now is the only form of sexuality I know and I just crave to finally be able to let this all rest and experiment with

a nice female who understands how hard I have been fighting through this combined with autism my whole life.

I am now sexually inactive but my libido is very high especially bc I am on a carnivore diet..

1483,addiction,2020/04/04,"My best friend has been missing for almost a week My best friend, a prior heavy opioid user who I believe relapsed, has been missing for 5 days. Life is too much.

When I was a senior in high school I got into weed and over the years it escalated until 21/22. I met a friend and eventually roommate trying to sell him mushrooms lol but I helped him get off heroin and live with me because he was basically living in a trap house before. Given his history or serious drug use I’m horrified that he is dead in a ditch with a needle in his arm because no one can reach him and we’ve searched all around his neighborhood and called his friends, coroners office, hospitals, and jails and nothing. I’ve lost 4 people to drugs and suicide since 2018, one on my couch. I found him dead in the morning from mixing fentanyl, oxy, Xanax, and rum. I’ve also witnessed a death involving severe trauma where he fell off a ramp and split his skull on the concrete and I was the only one with him while he died. It was also partially my fault, he was homeless and asked me to buy him cigarettes so I did and I gave him some free benzodiazepines when he was clearly drunk and he fell backwards over a guardrail on a ramp directly on his skull. I’ve lost others to suicide or overdose but I wasn’t there for those. 

Also, my brother is in serious danger with covid 19. He has mitochondrial disease and for someone with his diseases he is fairly healthy and normal and a 19 year old college freshman. Unfortunately mitochondrial disease affects muscle strength so while he can breathe just fine, he needs more time for altitude adjustments and he also gets dehydrated very easily which is why he has a feeding tube but that’s only a partial fix. His specialist said that if he gets sick there’s a 70% chance of him being admitted to the ICU on a ventilator and that’s horrifying because we don’t have enough and if they have to ration them to the people most likely to live, he will die.

I’ve overdosed, had my dad get violent with me and drive drunk with me, I handled my parents divorce alright and I’ve made it through watching my brother starve to death when I was 6-8  before we could figure out what was wrong and what to do. So my entire life I’ve been in crisis mode and I can’t take it anymore, I can’t take all of the death.?",456,1.0,2,0.0043859649122807015

1488,addiction,2020/04/04,"Meth sucks you in quick but it feels so slow I was drugged and raped while blacked out on a lot of tequila and a lot of xanax. How do I know if I was blacked out? Because the only moments that were clear that night was his hands holding the pipe and lighter as I inhaled and what that meth felt like when I breathed it in. Then saying no one too many times as he had a grasp on my hair and decided he couldn't hear me.

I told him to leave me alone. Never talk to me again. I never willingly used. I know I didnt. Even if I don't remember saying yes to it, which I obviously had to if I inhaled and it was at my fking mouth, I would never in a million years use meth had I been sober. It fked my family up and I lived the life of a kid of someone with a strong addiction to it. I watched my parents come close to murdering each other as a little girl because they were high on meth. I was left at crack houses for days just 5 years old. So my mom could go get high and hope the rapist there would take away her responsibility to be a mom anymore and let her fly high without guilt. I was there, 7years old 3rd grade when the cops showed up night after night to tell my parents they're full of shit when they swear on being sober but eyes glossed to hell and back. I didn't know what it meant. My memories of my mom are such like that and of her hiding in her room, just to come out and yell or tell me I'm worthless, or fall asleep while eating a bowl of cereal. I didn't know what the fuck it meant. And it fucked me up up until finally the system put me in foster care. Then my real dad found me and took me in. Sober parent finally. All I knew at that point was things were different and I was finally safe. Right?

My rapist, the predator in his late 40s, addicted to meth for years, the man introduced to me by someone who I called my soulmate, someone who left me with him to let me be raped because he was scared of that man too. He never left me alone. Months flew by and he still kept trying to talk to me outside these apartments. I ignored him so many times. I was strong. I had no interest anyway, he fucking terrified me, having even came into a room with a closed door where I was sleeping alone and assaulting me. I was homeless and needed shelter. He was ""helping me"". That's what he calls it.

Life got the best of me. I was insecure. Stressed. Wanting to give up. And quite frankly, to be blunt, I was just fucking bored. I had too much time on my hands due to this virus making everyone stay home. Being triggered to remember my assaults everyday my predator tried to get my attention outside. That feeling of inhaling kept repeating in my head. Why not have fun for a night? make a bad impulse decision ? I already felt like scum of the earth, why not let someone validate that feeling and party while I'm at it? I even thought this through. I thought I was a levelheaded person. I've been doing the right things for a long time, I wasn't impulsive anymore, at least I thought.

Crazy thing about an impulse. I thought it was supposed to last only a little bit. Because impulse decisions are quick. No thought put into them. So when I thought thoroughly and weighed the pros and cons on consentually putting that pipe in my mouth and lighting it, I thought I was in the clear.

Sure, one night of it. Then I'm done. no harm no foul. But one night turned into two. Then the bag was empty when he handed it to me when I asked for it so I could smoke more. I had already thought so hard about my next hit. Fresh hit. Big. Amazing. It was defeating. Obviously I had to buy more, right? So two nights turned to three.

And on night three he did it again. I said I needed to get sleep. I can't let myself not sleep for three nights. I don't have a bed and it takes a toll . So I thought ok, I made it clear to not fucking touch me . I can sleep here on a comfy bed for once. It's fine. But when he thought I was asleep he did it again. And I froze. He just showed me he had a gun. There was others in the apartment with weapons. High. I don't know meth. Despite having firsthand experience now, I was still that little kid. I didn't know what was capable of happening if I stood up for myself. So I didn't. I froze. I submitted. I let it happen. And I hated it. Every fucking second. But he thought the xansx I took to help me come down was enough to keep me asleep and keep him in the clear. So fine. Maybe it was. Maybe then I can forget about it.

I didn't sleep. I let time pass by. And I smoked more.

Then night four was justified again. And by night five I said no more. Don't give me that shit. Why? Because I went from ""one fun night that's it"" to ""I told u I need to fucking smoke so can you just give me the fucking thing?"". From thinking through my actions to the only thinking was about that next hit.

5 nights. Less than a week. To make an addict. I felt terrified at the potential meth had to ruin my life and turn me into my parents. But when I took a hit it didn't matter. Why would it? I was fucking flying. Who gave a fuck about that? theres meth. A lot of it. And it felt fucking good.

But the comedown came when I realized I didn't want to keep going. I had to sleep anyway or risk becoming psychotic. I already have psychosis diagnosis under my belt. I was at risk. And felt myself on a tightrope with it going 4 nights not sleeping. Whether or not I wanted to stop, I had to fucking sleep.

The comedown was horrible. And my loved ones were scared for me. They were in the dark about my use. So I just looked like I was freaking out. I wanted to die. Nothing could've prepared me for the emotional shift from flying to buried in the ground. And the guilt of having done the shit , the amount I did, and it still gnawing in my head to just go take another hit to feel better drove me up the wall. I was forced a dose of my prescribed Xanax and some food, and off to sleep.

The next two days I was craddled by family to make it thru. Im lucky they were there, or I would've lost my entire life. No details needed. That's the damned truth and all you need to know. I almost lost everything over a 5 day meth binge. 

So I lasted two days ignoring the thoughts to take one more hit or spend one more night hitting it like it's an inhaler and I'm having hours long asthma attacks. Then I caved. Fuck it. I went to my predator.

 After spending the last few nights of that binge extremely uncomfortable and scared for my safety as a man three times the size of me, who's already assaulted and raped me multiple times, drinks alcohol and is higher than a kite on methamphetamine. I remembered my parents fighting on it. How close they came to murdering each other. So when I started to argue with him because I was becoming irritable after 4 nights no sleep, and he was getting angry, I submitted again. I was terrified. I remembered how strong he was when he forced me. I remembered the lack of respect for me. Why would he let me say mean things and not try to hurt me? He wouldn't. He did.

So why did I go to him again? Why did I hit it again? Not just one hit either. Hit after hit after hit after hit.....in 10 min I was literally weightless, I could not feel my feet hit the ground as I walked back home. I planned to go back. I admitted defeat. And it was fine, because I was high.

Time came to go back. What seems like a comedown came at the same time. Not as harsh this time. Just a slap in the face to say to me, don't be a fucking idiot. Just because I was one, doesn't mean I had to keep the ball rolling. This is one week of my life, I should consider myself lucky and step away while I still want to. While the thought of stepping away even crosses my mind. Because either I step away now, or I sign my life or a damned good chunk of it to methamphetamine and a predator. Do I really want to turn into a woman being sexually abused, addicted to meth? Lose my life? Family? Morals? Self?

No I don't. So even though i could. And the urge is strong. And I'm insecure. Stressed. Bored. Triggered. I'm not going to smoke meth tonight. I'm not going to be assaulted tonight. I'm not letting myself make more stupid fucking decisions and make a fool of myself. I am considering myself lucky and keeping this secret of the last week until I am in my grave and moving on........",1695,1.0,1,0.0005899705014749262

1493,addiction,2020/04/05,"Am I a functioning addict? I (21F) started drinking and smoking weed when I was 15. It immediately became a regular part of my life. By the time I was 17 I was using psychedelics and benzos as well. At that point in my life I had decent control and my drug use wasn’t causing any problems in my life. Everything changed after I graduated high school and got involved with a not so great group of people. I started using coke, mdma, meth on occasion, pain killers, ketamine, air duster (aka the devil), just everything except heroin and crack. The stuff I was doing before just increased significantly. For about 2 years that was my life. I maintained a restaurant job, but I would go to work on stuff frequently, and was doing drugs and drinking heavily everyday. 

I knew it was a problem and I wanted out. I don’t feel like I was a drug addict at that time, because I guess I didn’t match my idea of what a drug addict was. I didn’t go through withdrawals, I kept a job, there was days (even though few and far between) I’d be sober. But I do sometimes believe maybe I was. But there are people who struggle so much harder with it, and I don’t want to downplay their struggle by using the same label. 

I wanted to change though. I went back to school, just taking 2 easy classes. I’d go and rail adderall and coke in the bathrooms sometime. It wasn’t getting better, so I decided to leave home for a few months over the summer and go stay with my aunt across the country. I didn’t do drugs the entire time, but thought about them constantly. I just drank as much as I could without seeming like a junkie. 

It was a life changing experience for me. I came back and that’s when I changed. I enrolled in school full time, I was working, I spent less and less time with the people I did drugs with. But I was still using a few times a month. It has kept getting better, and I keep going longer and longer without using, but drugs are still somehow a huge part of my life. I would love for drugs to not be involved in my life at all anymore, but it makes me so sad and anxious to thing because man do I love drugs. And some drugs do truly have benefits for me, really only molly and psychedelics. 

What the current situation is is that I’ve realized I can’t control my use when I start. I have ADHD, I’m currently not on meds. But having ADHD and being in college is hard, so I find ways to get adderall frequently. I always tell myself I’ll just take one and I’ll be able to study. And then it ends up being way more, and I’m up for days and not eating and feel god awful. That it definitely my main problem right now, but I’m still able to keep up with school and be an honestly very good student, it doesn’t affects my relationships, or other responsibilities, and literally not even my family (who I live with and know all about my substance use when it was really bad) notices what’s going on. 

I think the last time I did coke was in January. Molly is my DOC, and I still do it, but I definitely don’t feel the addictive nature towards it at all. I’ve had a gram sitting in a drawer for like 2 months. But when I do it I go way overboard, If I have a gram and am already rolling really hard I keep going until that gram is gone. I drink sometimes, but really only socially and I never get blacked out or incoherent. I have completely cut off the group of people I started doing heavier shit with. Drugs don’t cause problems for me like they used to, and some of them are very beneficially. But I’m tired of always going overboard and then just feeling so horrible. 

TLDR; I have made significant improvements from where I was at. However, I realize I have an issue with adderall in particular. But I need to get back on ADHD meds because I just cannot keep up anymore. I don’t do drugs a ton anymore, but still multiple times a month (sometimes only adderall for the month). With any drug (except alcohol) I go wayyyyy overboard. So my question is was I drug addict? Am I a functioning addict now? I’m tired of this cycle, but I feel selfish if I were to seek help because it’s so minor compared to others struggles and I don’t want to take help away from people who need it more.

1494,addiction,2020/04/05,"I feel like if I could enjoy music sober, I’d be happy. I’ve also had a great love for music. I play many different instruments and listen to many different genres. 

When I was in highschool I found weed. I could listen to music I love, and just be content all day. You can just crawl in a little cozy hole, and it’s just you, weed, the music, and the universe. Obviously I did other things, but this was among my favorites. When I had to quit weed due to it causing anxiety, I lost that. Then came the anhedonia and I lost interest in music. Losing all interest in something you love feels like part of your soul is missing. It changes how you see and think about yourself. 

I’ve been using drugs on and off for a long time trying to get to that content place I was with music and weed. Kratom, phenibut, lyrica, adderall, ketamine, dxm, you name it. But drugs obviously have their downfalls. 

I’ve done the whole rehab and sobriety thing for long periods of time, and that’s when the anhedonia really kicks in. No pleasure at all from music. 

When I am enjoying music sober, things are usually going well in other aspects of my life. And vice versa. Rare that it may be. 

I realizing I’m pointing at a symptom and saying, if this was gone I’d be happy. But it really feels like that. I feel like it may never go back to how it was, enjoying music, and that causes a strong sense of dread I can’t shake. Feels bad man.",280,0.0,0,0.0

I had always wanted to quit, but I could never last for more than a few days. This quarantine has given me the chance to actually quit, because I'm under 21 and I'm living far from my plugs. I hate nicotine because it interferes with my physical goals, but I'm open to smoking weed once this is all over. 

Life sucks right now. I was severely fatigued, irritated, and dizzy but those symptoms have gotten a lot better. I've been jogging over a mile a day which has helped. I'm working out, but for some reason my body is taking forever to recover from being sore. 

Right now, nothing is fucking fun! I hate doing everything. I have exams to study for but I hate studying and can't focus. I don't want to play my instruments because it's boring. I've been playing a shit ton of video games but I'm getting bored of that after the first hour each day. Netflix is boring, I don't post much on social media and browsing other people's random shit is boring as fuck as well.

I've been smoking weed consistently for over a year now. I've never necessarily viewed weed as a bad thing in my life, I've always put it out as a good thing(""it helps with my insomnia"", ""I just like the high"", etc) but I'm reaching a point where I can't distinguish being high and being sober anymore. I don't know if it's the extremely high tolerance I have( I can 3-4 fat dabs in a row and be ""sober"" in less than an hour) or if it's all mental. I honestly don't know what I'm feeling anymore or what to think about it. I had dropped my bong last night and I had told myself yesterday that if my bong broke for whatever reason that's the reason from the universe to quit (I don't really believe in that kind of stuff but it was something to hold myself to). But then when it finally did I quick-epoxied it together (by using a torch toharden the glue faster)and smoked the rest of the wax I had even though I was almost definitely breathing in the toxic fumes of the glue I had used to put it back together.so naturally the next day being out of wax I hit up my plug and I picked him up to go pickup the wax from his supplier(his car is broken down at the moment). We get the wax, we smoke out of the half busted rig and I start to not feel great(from the fumes) and I make the split second decision to throw my rig out the window into a ditch never to be seen by me again. I give the wax that my plug gave me for helping him deliver and tell him to sell it to someone else I'm done.

So that's how we get to now, I ride out the rest of my shitty high, do some housework, and now I'm sitting here thinking about how I'm gonna get high tomorrow... I still have a pipe and I have some dirt weed that never got me high but my brain doesn't seem to care. I keep telling myself no more weed but I keep crawling back to it with some sorry excuse as to why it's okay....

1504,addiction,2020/04/05,"Tips, advice and experience on dealing with a relapse. Hello everyone! I know someone that’s recently had a lapse in judgment and decided to use again. So I thought asking others on this subreddit their opinion and if they have had a lapse or relapse, how they dealt with that situation. I’ve been in recovery for about 2 years or so and have had 3 relapses since I’ve started my journey and currently have around 18 months clean from opiates. Personally I think of a lapse/relapse as a learning experience more than I do a failure. You only fail when you give up. The way I like to explain a relapse is using a Gordon Ramsey metaphor. Do you think Gordon Ramsey became a master chef overnight or in a few years? No he’s failed countless times before he became a master chef but with each failure came a learning experience and the best experience is personal first hand experience. With each failure of a dish he learned a little more. He learned what worked and what didn’t. And after so many failed attempts he learned how to make that dish damn near perfect. Recovery and relapse is a lot like that. You can fail and turn it around. Learn from that experience. Or you can fail and keep it that way by giving up. So what’s your guys take on this topic. What worked for you? What’s your personal experience? And more importantly do you have a metaphor for recovery, lapses, relapses, or prolapses.",263,0.0,0,0.0

1506,addiction,2020/04/05,"Stopping vaping is 10 times harder than cigarettes? Just wanting to see if anyone can relate because oh boy is this hard.

I started smoking at 13, and stopped a year ago when I was 18. It really wasn't that hard for me to do, apart from the first two weeks, but even then it was manageable.

After that, I started vaping just because it helped with my nerves, and it helped me come off my ""Vyvanse"" high that I would get for the first hour after taking them (they are prescribed to me by a doctor.)

However, it's starting to become worrying for me. During the quarantine, I'm pretty much vaping all day. From the second I wake up to the second I go to bed. It's just a habit now to reach for it. I'll have a panic attack if I forget my vape at home, and sometimes I even grab it in my pockets inside a store before realizing. I know that most people will say that vaping does no harm, but the problem is the frequency. Right now, I'm in quarantine and I am not working/going to uni, so I can do it whenever I want. But once I have to go  back to uni, I'm seriously worried about how this is gonna affect me. I've tried everything, nicotine patches, going down to 0mg nicotine, chewing gum while using nicotine patches but nothing helps. I think I'm addicted to the motion? Does that even make sense? I don't even think it's the nicotine, I just think it's the action of doing it.

To give you a little background information, I grew up in a rough neighborhood, I was exposed to drugs from an early age.When I was a kid, around 6 or 7 me and my friends promised to each other that we won't ever do drugs (heroin in special as we saw what did to other older kids who would just nod out on the park benches where we would play) years later we started drinking then shortly after smoking weed and doing other hard drugs such as cocaine mdma ketamine acid xanax and meth. My biggest problem is weed, I smoked it every day for 3 years until 2 months ago when I stopped leaving my house because of the covid-19 situation but I am convinced that once this is over I ll get back on my shit, maybe even earlier as yesterday I tried to sneak out of the house to go pop ecstasy but my father caught me. I am ashamed of myself for risking my family's health by going to hang out with a bunch of my friends that I know for sure don't respect the social distancing and some of them present many symptoms of the virus. I tried many times to quit smoking weed and doing other drugs but as soon as I am near them or even think about them is like I flip a switch and is the only thing on my mind, I deceive myself that it's not that big of a deal and that I will stop someday. I am also addicted to the lifestyle, the streets and the connections I built over the time and I think that is even a worse addiction than my substance one as I feel that the kind of people I am surrounded by are the only ones who accept me and can relate to my problems , plus the fact that most of them I know since we were kids and we always had each others backs. I wish some day I will do things that are good for me, as I know that true happiness doesn't come from outside stimuli but rather from things you build for yourself, and that often isn't easy and requires will power  consistency and discipline, but for now I lack that, I feel like my brain is wired only for instant gratification and meaningless acts of momentary pleasure that at the end of the day just deepen the feeling that I am a spine less loser that can't keep his promises. I wish to hear some of yall s stories and maybe you could tell me how you manage to stay clean and what helps you.I know sobriety is a very bumpy road and that there is no guaranteed way to kick it for sure, and for that reason it scares me even more as I m so used to failing that at times I don't even want to think about trying anymore.

I know I'm prone to being an addict because I used to be addicted to a different thing in the past and it's just my personality to get obsessed over things. 

I use my phone, especially YouTube all day. And yeah, this is normal today I guess, but I feel like I can't do without it.
I watch YouTube 6 or more hours a day.
I wake up, go on my phone first thing and immeditaly turn on YouTube. I am actually watching YouTube while watching this.
Every night I stay up till 2am because I just have to watch one more video. It's infurating and I don't knoe why.
I deleted YouTube off my old phone and I re-downloaded it a day later because I felt so lonely. So empty.
I can't delete YouTube off my current phone so I watch YT always.
I know it's dumb, but I get crazy attached to YouTubers, I fall in love with them, they feel like friends. Cutting out YT feels like loosing a part of my friend group.
It's gotten to the point where it's affecting my grades because I watch YouTube instead of studying or looking for a job.
I basically stopped doing all of my other hobbies, I don't even really game anymore. But if I do anything it's with YouTube on.

It's probably not an addiction or anything, but I really don't know how to stop doing that.

1522,addiction,2020/04/06,"Struggling with blaming my boyfriend for his addiction My boyfriend had/has a weed addiction. He’s managed to quit for the last three weeks and of course I’m really happy about this. 

The problem is that I still feel resentful towards him for getting addicted and the way he treated me while addicted. I know that blaming people for their addiction is wrong, and I even semi-understand why my boyfriend got addicted in the first place, he was struggling to deal with something horrible that happened to him a couple of years ago. I’m not trying to bash anyone with an addiction here, I just genuinely need some advice/insight into how addiction works.

I’m resentful that I can’t occasionally get stoned with him now and that we can’t have sex while stoned sometimes like we used to, which was great. It feels like he’s ruined something that was fun for us and for me, I don’t have any friends who smoke so he was the only person I could get stoned with. 

I’m resentful about how he lied to me. I’ve never felt like I couldn’t trust him before this, it‘s a strange feeling. He lied about how often he was smoking, and I thought he was getting better a couple of times only to find out he’d been lying to me and was still smoking every night. He would also lie about if he was stoned or not, I couldn’t even tell if he was anymore.

I’m resentful about how he messed with my head. When I first brought up how I was worried about his smoking, he made it seem like there was no problem at all and that I was being controlling. I was so sure I was right but then I really started doubting myself and didn’t bring it up again for a while.

I’m resentful about how he pressured me into smoking with him, and how he guilt tripped me into giving back his weed even when he was trying to quit. 

I’m resentful about the person he became while addicted. He became boring, unmotivated and his only hobby was smoking weed. I love him, but I really didn’t love who he was becoming. 

I’m resentful about how it affected our sex life. He couldn’t get it up properly without being stoned, I think he had just gotten used to feeling of being stoned and jerking off loads.

1523,addiction,2020/04/06,"why do I keep snorting cocaine high on cocaine right now and I just don't want to feel alone with this problem, gonna make this quick and hopefuly i have some answers.

im 19 about to turn 20 this month and im wondering if I have permanent damage to my brain or nose.

\- in a period of 6 months i snorted about 8000-10000 dollars of cocaine (had the money cause I worked at a car dealership then quit and went broke so I ended up quitting) (1-4 GRAMS A DAY for 6 days a week, my 1 day was to recover to eat,sleep, and let my nose heal because it burned so bad.)

\- my nose is still red on the inside and i still blow out white stretchy mucus after being sober for 3 months but i do it about once a month now so im not sober i guess. WHEN will my nose fully heal?

i thought i was clean, i get random mood swings where I feel really sad when i wake up but sometimes I get a rush of energy in the middle of the day that started sad and heavy and later on the day i feel great for no reason or I just feel sad or energetic all day for an entire week then it switches. IS THIS normal? i think it is but just want to know for sure.

last question, why do I keep doing it? I have so much regret when i finish my come down which is so awful but im a dog when it comes to cocaine. I got offered a free half gram and my heart started racing and my mouth started salivating and I rushed for a 30 minute drive to it so excited when I haven't thought about it in weeks. WHEN WILL that feeling go away when offered free coke?

is my brain damaged temporarily or permanent or am I in placebo?

  by Laurence Paul Dunbar


We wear the mask that grins and lies,

It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,—

This debt we pay to human guile;

With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,

And mouth with myriad subtleties.


Why should the world be over-wise,

In counting all our tears and sighs?

Nay, let them only see us, while

       We wear the mask.


We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries

To thee from tortured souls arise.

We sing, but oh the clay is vile

Beneath our feet, and long the mile;

But let the world dream otherwise,

1529,addiction,2020/04/06,"How I overcame my PMO(Porn, Masturbation and Orgasm) addiction in 30 days I'm in my early 20s and I used to be addicted to PMO (At least 1 - 2 sessions everyday. Could end up with 5 sessions in a single day. Of course, after each session I would feel sleepy and lazy. I could not even control my urges before and during big moments like examinations and approaching deadlines).

I have stopped for the past month and haven't had an urge strong enough to make me relapse at all. Even if I felt the urge, I was never overwhelmed by it and I had it under control with minimal effort. This was the first time where I felt like I was not even trying to suppress my excessive horniness. It just went away. I don't even think about it anymore. I don't even entertain dirty thoughts in my head. I'm confident in my ability to maintain this lifestyle for the rest of my life.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

What worked for me:

*1) Cleaning up my diet.*

I have cut out **all** added oils in my diet and began consuming a salad before every meal. Plus I only have animal products (fish and eggs) for one meal every two days. But I ensure that I meet my daily requirement for healthy fats. As a result I have gotten a lot leaner.

2) *Not having my phone next to me at bed time*

This one's a no-brainer.

3) *Supplementation.*

I began taking Omega 3 (vegan), Zinc Picolinate, Ashwagandha &amp; Bacopa monnieri extract. I'm not sure if it is a placebo, but I'm fairly certain that Bacopa and Ashwagandha give me a mental clarity that aid me in suppressing my desires. I take Omega 3 and Zinc since I follow a primarily plant based diet.

4) *I do heavy resistance workouts 6 times a week and play basketball at least twice a week.*

This probably helps me feel tired enough to drain my body of its ability to feel horny all the time.

5) *Improving my posture*

This could be a result of point 4, but I used to hunch a lot when I walk. Now, I maintain a more neutral thoracic spine and appear and feel more confident and masculine as a whole. This was a product of strengthening the muscles around my neck and upper back.

6) *Adopting a more conservative view*

This one is probably a little controversial, especially here on reddit. But I began to value and respect modesty and the sanctity of sex and females in general. I began to view immodestly dressed women as distractions more than anything else. This by no means mean that I do not respect them. I simply think of them as tests that I have to pass with my newfound will power :)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now, I did not isolate the individual factors to see which was the most effective at curbing my addiction. But I don't want to. I'd like to attribute my success to my general sense of well being.

I have tried at least 5 unsuccessful attempts in the past where I would relapse within 2 weeks. My past attempts were unsuccessful as I felt like I was simply trying to not do it instead of tackling it from a different angle (eg. well being and mental health). Once I did relapse, I will go at it for 3 to 4 times in a row and end up feeling depressed.

I have used this quarantine period as an opportunity to better myself. I understand that staying at home all day could breed negative thoughts. But it doesn't have to!

If negative reinforcement does not work for you, try approaching the problem from another angle. You could have been fighting the wrong battle all along. Focus on something else. All of us are built differently and we respond to different stimuli differently. You don't have to go cold turkey either. It started with me doing it less frequently until I just did not feel like doing it anymore.

Good luck!

1530,addiction,2020/04/06,"I have an addiction to psychic readings Every since I was 12, I discovered a way to ease my anxiety and have my own (kind of) therapist -- psychic readings. 

I've spent upwards of $15,000-$20,000 since the age of 12 on psychic readings (currently 21) and although it does ease my anxiety and, in the past, helped with my depression (during middle school and high school), I now have this dependency on psychic readings every time I feel stress or anxiety. I get at least 1-5 readings/day. 

I used to justify this as a ""medical expense"" (obviously it's not) but I'm now realizing that it's detrimental to my finances and mental health because of my dependency on these readings.

1534,addiction,2020/04/06,"Get Clean on the beaches of Reddit Nation  

Hello all,

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

the subbreddit is reddit.com/[r/theredditnation](https://www.reddit.com/r/theredditnation/)

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy (for now I will be the “king”)  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

He ran out of his weed and cigarettes now he is drinking beer. He is always looking for something to do to not be sober. What can I do to help him?

It feels like my sober self is a completely different person who I haven't been in touch with in a long time, I feel like I am going to have to meet and get to know my sober self all over again. As I'm beginning to take less, I am also beginning to experience withdrawal symptoms.

Let me just say, what I am feeling/experiencing is dark as fuck. Like it's actually scary, I would not wish this feeling on my worst enemies. It's not the worst I've ever felt in my life, but it's definitely comparable to it. So I just have one question...

I know that there are people out there who have certainly taken higher dosages than me to an even greater extent than I have for an even longer (sometimes much, much longer) period of time, but given my situation; having taken Adderall (\~30-40mg a day) for a over about a year straight, how long can I expect withdrawal symptoms to last? I know they are not permanent but I just want to know how long I should prepare to feel like this for.",339,0.0,0,0.0

1551,addiction,2020/04/08,"advice on quitting adderall.. with a long back story for context lol Okay so I got prescribed adderall when I was a little girl took it up until middle school then stopped taking it because I had the memory of a gold fish and it was a low dosage so I wasn't completely dependent on it. In the time I didn't take it I was a full time competitive cheerleader practicing 5 days a week hours on end training and conditioning. I had well enough energy for me and never thought about the drug. 

While in high school I heard one of my friends talking about how they got prescribed and it was the best thing ever and I remember asking myself ""I wonder why I stopped taking my prescription?"" . Probably not long after that I started my prescription back up at a 20mg dosage and felt like a whole new productive me. I lost weight and felt like I was on top of the world but never really correlated the adderall and my productiveness, I was a dumb high schooler I know. But after my body started getting used to my 20 mg dosage I soon realized I hadn't been doing the same in sports or school and decided maybe I need to up my dosage so now I have been taking a 30 mg dosage ever since.

I am 20 years old will be 21 in September (:

I am wanting to enlist into the military and have to stop taking it...

To be quite frank I'm scared shitless, because after switching to the 30 mg dosage I started to depend on adderall more and more. Say I accidentally forgot to take it one day or my pharmacy didn't fill my prescription in time I will break down in a anxiety attack because the effects of not taking it after taking it for so long are ruthless and just didn't want to have to go through it. The complete lack of energy I have and the appetite of 4 grown men really do a toll on me. I never really thought anything of it and didn't take it seriously, I just thought that it was me being lazy.

I don't know the clear defining of being addicted or being dependent on the drug I just know when I wake up I just have a routine of waking up taking my adderall having a coffee and some breakfast then after it would start to kick in I would proceed to do what I had to do that day.

I have tried not to take it weeks at a time, not stopping all together, every once and awhile because I didn't think the adderall was the thing making me, me. I would eventually gain weight from the constant eating, and then proceed to sleep and sleep and sleep. Eventually ending up taking it again thinking I didn't take it for a week and didn't like the person I was and just thought that was my personality.

SOOOO with all that said I don't even know where to start. I don't think slowly reducing my dosage will work, I feel FOR ME, I just have to stop taking it all together. I'm hoping there are people who have gone through similar situation or just even quitting the drug like I am attempting to do.

Tomorrow I am not going to take my adderall and need advice on what to do to help the crash of the drug. I am desperate for any tips because I am so scared of the physical and mental exhaustion from stopping.

This time in quarantine is not helping, but let's be real I was popping pills prior to this. I used to have a very bad addiction to adderrall, my own script, buying it off the street, stealing it from my family who have scripts, hundreds of mg a day. I did well for so many years, 5 years to be exact. I don't know why I relapsed. I've had access to it in the past and knew very strongly to steer clear. This time around I indulged and I've been indulging almost every other day now, sometimes for days and days. I have access to 10mg pills right now. Only taking up to 4 a day and that's pushing it. Sober I feel so empty, hateful, and let's be real bored. I live in a state that there isn't as easily accessible recovery programs, especially programs that aren't super Christian based. I'm not religious, if anything I have an unhealthy resentment towards the Christian god. Been through a lot in my 30 something years, have lost almost all hope solely because I've seen and experienced such awful things on part of the human race. Also, I am an empath. I feel silly when I say that, but it's true. I, like others I'm sure suffer from the pain around me. My soul can't help but absorb it, my brain can't help but react as if it is experiencing first hand the turmoil of others. 

I miss sober me. I've become dependent on adderrall to function. Maintain my life, feel some sort of happiness and relief. But I have in the past felt happiness and relief, been able to maintain a job and a household without adderrall, why now am I so hooked like I need it to survive. I'm at a loss. I am normally able to pull myself from these binges, but this time around it's as if I am sludging through shit sucking me under, losing strength in my legs as I attempt to pull each foot out of it and walk forward.

1564,addiction,2020/04/08,"I think I'm an addict, I'm thinking this now so that probably means I am (my long vent, I could use support right now) I've (23F) been constantly chasing a rush for a long time and I'm afraid I'm headed down a bad path that's gonna get worse if I don't stop right now. I'm definitely addicted to nicotine, I smoke like once or twice a day but that's me trying to cut down now, I've been a lot worse. I've been using nicotine pouches, the really strong ones multiple times a day. I drink energy drinks and highly caffeinated drinks all the time because I love the buzz from that.

The main point though is I'm getting addicted to my Ritalin and it's causing some problems. I probably made a mistake from the getgo by trying to get the prescription, I have actual ADHD and was diagnosed when I was really young and took Strattera for around 5 years before I was taken off it because of the mood and behavior changes it gave me. Over the course of the next 13 years I was constantly on the verge of failing every class and was completely dysfunctional as a person. Then I decided to ask to get put on Ritalin and they gave it to me. 5mg twice a day. I knew it would help me but I was also well aware that it could get me fucked up if I took enough of it. The first night I took it I did exactly what my doctor told me not to do and took it at night and the euphoria was pretty great, not completely intense like I'm sure coke or meth is but definitely better than nicotine and caffeine. The next day I took more pills to get some housework done, maybe 15 or 20 mg. I didn't do this much during the first month, maybe a few times but I think at most I was using 30. I also just wasn't using it to study and focus but also just because it made me feel great. It was legitimately helping me when I took the right dose but not enough. I asked the doctor for a higher dose, she gave it to me and now my current dose is 10mg twice a day and another 5mg for late afternoon.

That was the beginning of when I think the seeds of addiction started sprouting in my brain. I went through that script, all 750 mg in the course of a week, it was also the first time I snorted it which just gave me an even bigger rush. That's a general theme with all my substance use, I have to have more and more, I don't like to stop because I don't want the high to end. I don't consider myself an alcoholic but on the rare occasion I do drink, maybe once or twice a month I always get really fucked up and binge drink. Weed I just keep smoking and smoking when my high goes away. The surprising thing though was when the rest of the script was gone I was bummed about it, not even distressed totally, for maybe an hour or two and I got over it. 3 weeks went by and I barely thought about it. Then I could fill my next script which was a partial 15 day supply because I couldn't see my doctor. That was my worst night because in the course of 15 hours I took around 120 mg of it., about half went up my nose. The rest of the script was gone a day and a half later. I wear a Fitbit so I can track my heart rate and it would sometimes shoot up to 130 just walking around doing stuff in the house, I was worried but I always eventually ignored it.

Around the same time I got that script I told my brother who's also an addict about my using. He was concerned and said I shouldn't do it. I brushed it off and said I have it under control.

Two more weeks go by and I've gotten my most recent script about 5 days ago. I told myself I wouldn't snort it and I haven't had the desire to, it's actually more convenient to just pop them. The effect lasts longer and it doesn't fuck up my sinuses and make my heart rate that bad. It still got pretty high though, resting bpm was around 100. I also said I would use less pills. I'm sticking to around the FDA maximum dosage which is 60mg a day. So I've probably taken a ten day supply in the past 5 days. Better but I'm realizing things are getting a little fucked up again. I find myself wanting it as soon as the euphoria wears off and to have it to stay awake and energized and hyper focused. I have a lot of classes and I will say I got soooo much shit done and have been taking it to study, so that's the only real plus. Now I'm sitting on my couch about an hour or two ago and I'm noticing my heart is kinda feeling a bit cold. I'm googling heart attack symptoms and stuff like the link between Ritalin and heart problems and my resting heart rate is still a bit high (90 bpm) from my earlier doses. I took 45mg in the course of a few hours so I could study earlier in the day.

That's when I realized, this is really fucked up. I'm legitimately googling if I could be doing major harm to my body right now as a result of my drug misuse/abuse. I mean I'm probably alright in the short run but if I keep this up there's a chance I could die.

So that's what's leading me to here. I might be an addict, but I'm admitting that and saying I can't give up the Ritalin because it can still help me. I'm gonna take it as prescribed or at most take one extra pill if I really need to. I'm promising myself if I step over that line I'm gonna flush these down the toilet because I know I can live without them. And also I did grow up with family members in NA and AA so I know what I just said sounds like addict talk and bullshit but I don't care. Despite everything I still have been succeeding in life and the benefits outweigh the risks for me. I can't give this up, I'm actually living for once in my life and everyone around me has noticed the difference.

Before anyone says anything I won't go back on Strattera, that didn't help me, it just made me worse. I'm also not going to NA and I think I've made up my mind about that. I think total abstinence is necessary for a lot of people but not for everyone. I can smoke weed occasionally and drink and that's never been much of a problem for me, it's never gotten to the point where I felt like it was having a seriously negative impact on my life. I even took Xanax and Ativan a few times and while they were fun I could put them down with no problem.

So here goes nothing, tomorrow starts day one of trying to manage this. I could use any prayers or positive vibes sent my way. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read my long ass vent.",1326,0.0,0,0.0

Addictive drugs are said to often worsen memory, and anecdotal reports of drug-users with poor memory are abundant. But what if these reports are wrong? What if drugs of abuse can improve memory under particular circumstances? In this episode, Michael Wolter - Neuroscience PhD Candidate - joins us to discuss how heroin and other drugs of abuse (including cocaine &amp; nicotine) can enhance memory for events immediately preceding drug intake. This work has vast implications for the development of addiction, and for preventing relapse to addictive drugs. In fact, drug-linked experiences stored in the brain's long-term memory centres are believed to be largely responsible for relapse to drug seeking behaviour and drug abuse, even after long periods of successful abstinence.

Manuscript: Modulation of object memory consolidation by heroin and heroin-conditioned stimuli: Role of opioid and noradrenergic systems. Published in the journal European Neuropsychopharmacology: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32067860

Abstract
There is recent evidence that cocaine, nicotine, and their conditioned stimuli have the ability to enhance memory consolidation. The present study compared the effects of post-training heroin and of a heroin contextual conditioned stimulus (CS+) on consolidation of object recognition memory and investigated the roles of opioid and beta-adrenergic receptors in heroin/CS+ memory modulation by co-administering the respective antagonists, naltrexone (NTX) and propranolol (PRO). Three experiments were performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrating that immediate, but not delayed, post-sample exposure to heroin (0.3, 1 mg/kg), or exposure (30 min) to a contextual CS+ paired with 1 mg/kg heroin (5 pairings, each 120 min), equally enhanced object memory. Importantly, while the memory enhancing effects of 1 mg/kg heroin and of the contextual CS+ were not altered by post-training co-administration of 3 mg/kg naltrexone, they were blocked by post-training co-administration of 10 mg/kg propranolol. Taken together, these data suggest that a context paired with heroin shares the memory enhancing effect of heroin itself and that these unconditioned and conditioned drug stimuli may modulate memory through the activation of beta-noradrenergic receptors.

1577,addiction,2020/04/09,"The story of my drug use and what I’ve learnt. I have tried my best to Make this trigger free but I am still going to provide a warning just in case. 

I have been sober for nearly 4 months now, I remember one of my therapists telling me to write a story of my drug use and to and talk about why I chose to indulge and what I got from it. So I thought  I would share it with you guys as I feel my experiences  may encourage others who are thinking about stopping.

Through the ages of 16-19 I was using drugs everyday. My drugs of chose where  Weed, MDMA, ketamine, Cocaine and Xanax. I feel the best way to talk about my addiction is looking at the individual drug and what I used it for.

MDMD: The first “hard drug I used” at the age of 16. All the problems that I had inside my head at the time from my childhood, all the insecurities and worries were elevated by this drug. Up until this age I never really had a friends, MDMA made me feel like people wanted me around and enjoyed being with me. I fell into a habit of taking this drug way not often than I should have.

XANAX: I first encounter this drug shortly before I when to university, it was the reason I had to drop out. This drug I largely used as a way of numbing some of the same feelings I was using MDMA to avoid. After about half a year of daily use I finally decided that I didn’t want to live anymore and took 10 bars  (20mg) along with a glass of vodka. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital. What stands out most from that hospital visit was when I looked directly into my parents eyes and admitted to them for the first time that I had a problem, this destroyed me. I decided to get a tattoo to remind my self of this point in time and how I got over it (I can post if wanted)I haven’t used Xanax since. Xanax took soo much away from me so quickly, the Thought of it still scares me, that’s possibly why i don’t feel the urge to use it anymore.

Ketamine: I used ketamine for its psychedelic side, I would often snort grams at once to achieve the state I wanted to be in. The escape I got from this drug was unmatched by any other substances I took. I used this drug everyday in excess for about 3 months and very often for a further 6. One time I was doing a load of CKs (Ket + Coke) and blacked out, when I woke up I found out that I had gone bat shit and attacked my dad. Sadly this is the drug I miss most out of them all, whenever I get the urge to get high it is usually for ketamine. 

Cocaine: This post is long enough so I won’t go into too much detail about this. Used it maybe weekly for a year and about monthly for about 2 years. Very selfish drug. It used to turn me into a complete prick, I thought I was the shit of course though. The main reason I took this drug was as a social aid, having no friends through my childhood made socialising difficult and daunting for me.


My Advice.
So many times I have told my self I’m not going to take substances anymore, and every time my down fall has been persuading myself it’s a “one of”. I realise now that my downfall directly to relapse is exceptions. Every time I get the urge to take something I remind myself, if I take this I’m going back to how I was, I’m trying not to kid myself into thinking I have a sense of control when I don’t. 

When I tell my self I’m going to be going back to my old ways, it’s easier to put the urges aside.

My therapist once said Deciding you want to quit is the hard part, Once you have truly decided Quitting is easy.

It took me so long to acknowledge this because I would always tell myself that I didn't have a problem because I don't use every day.

But I have done and said things that I normally wouldn't just so I could get high, and if that's not a sign of an addict, I don't know what is.

So now I'm motivated to get clean and stay clean, for as long as I can. Does anyone know any apps that will help me track my addiction and my journey? Or any websites?

I've already signed up for drug counselling, and I'm gonna call the local AODS (Alcohol &amp; Other Drugs Service) for support next week.

I've told my close friends and family (some didn't even know I used meth at all), and I have an amazing support network established.

Not sure how to start, but I just got out of an extremely abusive relationship and unfortunately weed has been (and still is) my only ‘coping mechanism’. It started in January, so it’s been more than a year, and only increased in severity because of increasing trauma and pain. Where am I rn is, I don’t think I have spent more than 2 hours sober the past two months, with the exception of a couple of days where I had to go to work. I can’t deal with the pain and anger I’m feeling, I can’t deal with thoughts and constant flashbacks. It also helps me with eating, otherwise I feel like someone is force feeding me and sometimes just throw up after eating. My typical day starts with me waking up, immediately smoking (since the thoughts are immediately there too) until I pass out. And then wake up and repeat. Most of the times I would wake up at like 4 am with terrible stomach pain and nausea and throw up literally nothing, would dry heave to a point where my back muscles are cramped and almost grovel back to my bed in shivers so I can smoke myself to oblivion again. This is pretty much my life for at least 4-5 months, with fluctuating severity, but this is a very accurate description for Feb and March. And April seems to be the same. First it was just day smoking and watching the same stupid tv series over and over again to distract myself instead of going to work, then I would stop for a couple of days because I would also get some ‘support’ from my ex who was pretty much my only friend and family, also the only person who knew I smoked (tho he never took it as an actual problem) until he does something to hurt me and it would be back to weed. I didn’t see a pattern back then because there were ‘good days’ in between and I was still somehow able meet my responsibilities and be okay, but now everyday is the same and I feel so disappointed when I wake up to a new day, because I have to exist. I honestly don’t know how I’m still employed because I have been just cancelling things, coming up with excuses and not meeting any of my deadlines.

1597,addiction,2020/04/10,"Just Dropped Mom Off at Rehab... Hey guys.  As the title says, we just took my mom to rehab.  She's been dealing with alcohol addiction for a few years now.

I think I just kinda need to rant about it.

I knew she was drinking, and it's a relatively new thing for her.  She was never a teetotaler.  She was a typical social drinker when I was growing up.  She would get a margarita or something like that when she went out with friends maybe a few times a month.  She didn't drink other than that, and I never saw her drunk that I know of as a kid.

As far as I know she never really had any problems with it until a couple of years ago, but it got bad fast.

I didn't realize how bad it had gotten.

When COVID 19 was first coming to the U.S. I decided to move back in with my parents until it passes as I can work from home, and they live in a much more rural area than me with a much lower infection rate for COVID 19 (don't hassle me about this.  I know I risked them by travelling to them.  We all knew the risks and accepted them.)

It wasn't until I was consistently around her that I saw what the addiction had done to her.  She was basically living off of alcohol.  I seriously don't know when the last time she had anything to eat that wasn't either liquor, the mixers she used for liquor, or some other type of alcohol.

It was insane.

She decided to go to rehab on her own.  She saw a doctor for an unrelated reason a few days ago, and she decided to tell them everything about her alcohol problem.  A few days later, we got her admitted to a facility.

I know she wanted to go, and she knew it needed to be done, but she was still so nervous about it.  She drank today up until right before we got to the facility.  We didn't try to stop her.  We just let her do her thing.  

When she got checked in, the first thing she did was blow a breathalyzer.  

She blew a .32.

I know for sure that she was nowhere close to as drunk as I've ever seen her.

I didn't know it was that bad.

My father was a cocaine addict and alcoholic, and my mother was addicted to Adderall. My grandfather was an alcoholic, and my uncle was addicted to Xanax and also an alcoholic.  
I was always the good kid growing up. I had great grades, a sweet heart, and a poetic talent and spirit. However, I was never happy. Ever since 12 years old, I'd had suicidal thoughts. Ever since Grade 1, I'd always been bullied by other kids and never accepted in any friend groups.  
I always was intelligent, but hated myself. I never loved myself for who I was because I felt as if nobody else did.

  
 So, at 12 years old I'd smoked weed for the first time and LOVED it. At 13 years old, I became a daily pot smoker and LITERALLY did not stop at all until just 4 days ago at 17. My dad supplied me with weed to, ""stay off of the other drugs,"" but really I ended up just being unhappy with only smoking weed and got into harder stuff.

  
 Freshmen year, age 15, I got expelled from higshchool. I drink half a jar of moonshine not knowing how strong it actually was. I ended up calling the cops on myself thinking it would be funny. After that, I entered a HUGE depression because I had no friends, my family thought I was a loser, and all I had was Mary Jane to get me through those days.  
Throughout the 3 year span from then and now, I'd tried a handful of drugs. Spice, Oxy, LSD, Adderall, Vyvanse, Cocaine, MDMA, DXM, Alcohol, Xanax, came DANGEROUSLY close to trying meth and heroin, and smoked massive amounts of pot. I also got super hooked on first cigarettes, but enjoyed vaping high nicotine e-liquid better.  
But something about the stimulants hooked me. And that happened just at the end of last year.  
I kept on rationalizing to myself that it was just recreational and that I would do it, ""just one more time.""

  
 One more time turned into 8 straight months of hell and addiction to a level I've never before experienced. Doing line after line, popping pill after pill, and watching litterally 100s and 100s of hours of porn while geeked out of my MIND. It is still somewhat triggering to talk about it, because the memories of being high bring back such STRONG feelings within me.   
But I am now 10 days clean of any adderall or cocaine. I am 4 days clean of marijuana. And tommorow, I know it's finally time for me to put down nicotine and, the least harmful (but still harmful) drug of my choice, caffeine.  
I make rap music, play guitar, write poems and songs, listen to music, and spend time with my recovering brother (who gives me such great motivation to stay clean). This helps me stay sober.  
But there's definitely times throughout the day where I don't feel like doing anything but laying in bed wallowing in my sorrow.  
I know this withdrawal is not permanent, but I also know that I will always have the addict inside me, and that recovery is a LIFELONG proccess.   
Thank you so much for listening to my story, it means the world to me:)",643,0.0,0,0.0

1605,addiction,2020/04/11,"I think my sister is on the path to become an addict. How can I help and get through to her? This was originally posted or r/relationship_advise but I thought to post here too in case someone here had  good insight. 

My sister (F24) has always been a trouble maker and has experimented with drugs (weed) from an early age. As we’ve grown out of that rebellious stage I thought she had matured and stayed away from any hard drugs and was getting her life together. However a few months ago she mentioned she had tried coke. This alarmed me because although I support weed use ( to a certain extent) that’s where I draw the line. She has an addictive personality (smokes weed daily and although it’s not physically addictive I believe she’s physiologically addicted  and I have spoken to her about cutting back on that) and so I told her to please stay away from it. However, she admitted to not only doing it more times but also dwelling on pills and other hard drugs she would not tell me about. Me and my brother had a bit of an intervention a couple weeks ago.The biggest problem during that conversation was getting her to understand it was INDEED a big deal (she was saying it wasn’t , it was only a few times, she wasn’t addicted to it ...ect). Although she would not  promise she wouldn’t do it again I really thought we got through to her. I was wrong. Tonight she came home in what looked like a drunken stage but she did not smell of alcohol and it just looked...off. I’ve seen her drunk and it wasn’t quite it. She wouldn’t tell us what it was. The worst part ...she drove home in that stage. I am at a loss. I cannot fathom how an adult can make such a reckless decision that can have so many devastating consequences. She could’ve killed herself, she could’ve killed someone else , she could’ve ruined too many lives (she could hardly get in her room that’s how bad it was). I’ve tried talking to her, making her understand, show her that we are loosing sleep over her decisions. I talk to her calmly , I talk to her like a friend, I play nice and I play tough too and NOTHING seems to get through and I just don’t know anymore. Dealing with her poor choices has been something I’ve dealt with MY ENTIRE LIFE. Preventing her from getting in trouble and hiding it from my parents has been a full time job since I was born and I am exhausted. I feel like she’s too old to be doing this and that she should know better, I mean when is it gonna stop? I am beyond worried, and now that she came home like this so are my parents because it’s now apparent to them there is a problem. I know my sister better than anyone yet it seems nothing I do gets through. What am I doing wrong? How do I make her understand this is not ok? Help me understand, thank you.

Ps: in case there are questions about why she was out (most places have a stay at home orders at the moment due to COVID-19) my city allows for people to go on runs as long as there’s social distancing. She often drives to a woody area to run or will walk there so it wasn’t strange that she went out during quarantine but I don’t think she was there tonight. I think it’s likely she broke quarantine and drove somewhere else",632,1.0,4,0.006329113924050633

My friend who I am no longer around or really in contact with recently texted me and said they had been abusing Xanax for the past few years. I had a feeling something was wrong because the last few years their personality changed and they treated me terribly. Based on their behavior, I'm assuming it was the past 2-3 years. They told me that they are ""no longer using it"". My question is, can they really be sober from abusing an anxiety medication that is highly addictive without rehab or the help of a doctor?

I work in the medical field, and from my understanding, don't you need to be weaned off of the pills or at least be in a rehab program to do so? It just seems so unlikely that after years of use you could just miraculously be sober?

This morning I measured my BP and it was 115/63 and on another part I had 94 heart rate.
Upon rechecking was 114 in next 4 hrs.
Between these 4 hours, I smoked, had lunch and some cake and few glasses of prosecco.

I have slightly high motivation but cannot judge on a single day.

I am asking for advice on how to quit smoking and I am very worried with my health. Though my dentist sister who studied medicine said stats are fine and I shouldn't worry, I am afraid that she said so to not freak me out.

Normally with no lockdown and good weather I do running and work out as well. I am not lazy or so. I am quite active and I really do enjoy running.

1617,addiction,2020/04/12,"Addictive &amp; curious personality w/ a bf that’s “clean” from his addiction.. toxic or sustainable? I’m 21F and he’s 27M, we met a few months ago (I was single for 2 yrs before we met) and REALLY hit things off together, I thought that he was just so amazing and everything that I was looking for in a boyfriend/future husband but then I learned about his pervious addiction. 

I know I shouldn’t really care that much, it’s been 5-6 years since he’s touched heroin but when he told me it totally caught me off guard; I understand he’s trying to be open and honest with me so I don’t hear this from other people but then I learn about the molly, cocaine, alcohol, weed, shrooms. 

The weed, shrooms, and alcohol (to a point) I don’t have an issue with. I’ve personally never done cocaine or molly but I’ve done lsd, DMT, ketamine, addy, pills, weed but I have an EXTREMELY curious and addictive side to my personality. 
Since I didn’t know about his addiction prior to drinking and smoking with him it just became like an everyday thing. Which it is winter &amp; we aren’t working but he’ll go 2 days without drinking &amp; beings to feel better then goes and buys more alcohol even if I encourage him not to. He just says “it’s not like I have anything to do” which is a valid point. 

Once we started dating I realized his issue with alcohol right now, he withdrawn 2 times in under a month of us being together and tells me to “ not tell anyone “ especially his parents because they helped him get off of heroin &amp; he doesn’t want them to be concerned.. but shouldn’t I be concerned that he’s telling me that? 

Once he opened up to me about his addiction I felt more comfortable with telling him how my mind works and what I think about. Looking back on it now I probably shouldn’t have said anything but he’s the only person I could trust to even tell or ask questions about addictions. 
I told him I was curious about heroin, I always kind of have been and I know that I shouldn’t be. He was furious at me, I was furious at myself because I realized I shouldn’t have ever mentioned it. 
But Im scared I’m going to try it just to see what it feels like, to know what he dealt with, the feelings it gives people. 
It’s a disgusting thought to have because I never thought I’d be like this but I’ve had percs and other pain pills from my doctor before &amp; I enjoyed them which started my curiosity for harder drugs other than psychedelics I just don’t have the confidence to try them yet because of everything I’ve seen and heard growing up.  

Ever since we started dating I’ve been drinking more, smoking more, started smoking cigarettes again, and I’ve been barely eating because I hate being sober and I hate myself on top of being with a guy that told me “I usually date skinny women”.. that kinda hurt like i know I’m not the skinniest 😞 I have adderall in my college bag and I just want to take them to feel alright, lose weight, not feel as hungry all the time so I feel as if I’m enough for him. 

I think this might be toxic between us because he brings out my curiosity and I can bring out his addiction through my curiosity.. I really really want things to work between us but my whole life I’ve never really been around someone that’s an addict &amp; I know I have the possibility to be one myself too.

1622,addiction,2020/04/12,"Is it me or weed? Temper tantrums and smoking Am I alone? Has anyone else experienced this? How do you overcome it? Is weed making this happen to me? 

I (28f) have been smoking weed daily for about 8 years now (if not longer) as a way to self medicate from bad things in my past. By all logic I shouldn't smoke it because it tears my mental health apart and I think it's turning me into an awful person. 

I have always had a tenancy to be moody and let my emotions rule since childhood but recently I am having full blown temper tantrums. 

I suspect this is due to the low level anxiety I feel on a daily basis, and most of the time don't recognise, but it's over the tiniest of things. 

If something doesn't go my way or turn out the way I planned it utterly destroys my emotional restraint. I get angry, upset, anxious and tearful and if anyone else is around I am lashing out at them. This can go on for hours, and just like a kid I am stubborn and refuse to get out of the mood.

The worst part is, it's not really other people but my family/friends and partner that take the brunt. So it's definitely a learnt behaviour that can be changed and not a full on mental issue, but while I'm in that moment I can't seem to or don't want to stop. 

Tears, anger ""my life is shit and so am I"" full on pity party and then I will blame whoever is trying to console me. Afterwards I feel intense guilt, which then leads to smoking, which then leads to an evening of self berrating thoughts and paranoia. 

I can see that people around me are, well...fucking off away from it. And rightly so, but I wonder if this heightened irritability and almost childlike regression is weed? 

It's not dignified at all, I am nearly 29 years old and I'm getting irate over small things and taking it out on those closest to me - and I cant stop myself in the moment. Or maybe I won't stop myself?

1633,addiction,2020/04/13,"Opponent-Process Theory Conception of Withdrawal I've been reading about the opponent-process theory of addiction posited by Soloman and Corbit. 

If I understand it, a countervailing affective process B is generated in response to process A, the initial neural response to a stimulus such as a narcotic. 

The brain adapts to the stimulus and generates an increasingly strong opponent process as the nervous system seeks to impose transience on any sustained feeling that could peturb the brain's neutral state.

Withdrawal is this countervailing b process outlasting the drug's effect.

My question is; why isn't the state of withdrawal itself not counteracted naturally by the addicted subject's brain if it is so sensitive to peturbation? Surely, withdrawal could eventually be interpreted as a sustained negative peturbation of the base state?

My memory is starting to get hazy. It’s scaring me tbh. 

I’ve failed time and time again in keeping my word. Breaking promises to friends and family. Betraying their trust. I kept blaming everything around me for what was going on. When the real issue was me. Running away from my “responsibilities”.

I’ve been lying to myself for so long I can’t differentiate the difference between the truth and the lies.

Worst of all is the pain and heartache I’ve caused to my family, friends and loved ones. The hell I must have put them through.

I’m sorry. I’m sorry to have let down everyone who believed in me. To those whom I lied to time and time again. The sleepless nights and days spent by the phone worrying if I was still alive or not.

I am at a place where I want to turn certain aspects of my life around. I'm not ""in the gutter"" so to speak, I have been a somewhat functional addict, though if I am honest with myself, I have not lived up to my potential. There is also a pretty dark secret side to my life that others just don't see or know the depths of. I know I have personal demons I have tried to numb and escape from. And in the numbing and escaping, I have created more personal demons. It is a bad cycle that I want to get out of. I am too old for this, and I feel like I am getting at an age where there is a bit of a crossroads, and I need to decide where I am going to head from here. I am further along this life's path than I'd like to admit, and ignoring life like I have in many ways so far starts to look a little grim.

In regards to the regrets, I can get pretty bummed out over all the doors that have closed in my life over time, whether because of any direct action on my part, or even more so inaction. I was helpless with my stuff for so long, in many ways I just skated through life, not actively engaging being the person I would have wanted to be. There is some background trauma that I feel drove a lot of this. I know I have to do a lot of work on acceptance, I need to make good choices, and I need to start focusing more on the doors that are open for me in the present. They are there, but I will not lie, I get really stuck on what I missed out on. This is a big one for me.

In regards to resentments, and what brought me to post this, I just got very triggered thinking about family resentments. I have gained a lot of clarity in my life as to how everything unfolded, why things were the way they were. There is some anger there. Again, I need to work on acceptance, and I need to get more in the present, making my life more worthy of one worth living going forward.

I am not sure what else to add, I just wanted to get this off my chest. I want to think a little more about how regrets and resentments play into my addictive behaviors.

My boyfriend of almost three years has finally agreed to check himself into a rehab facility for his cocaine addiction. I am SO relieved and he actually seems sort of excited about it which is awesome. We made the call to the facility together this morning and I've been on cloud 9 ever since. I started doing some more research on my own (googling stuff like ""how to be a supportive girlfriend while my boyfriend is in rehab"" and ""what relationship changes should I expect after rehab"", etc) and I happened upon a topic that made me a bit uneasy... 

There seems to be a common trend of people being ""brainwashed"" into ending their current relationships while in rehab. I know that this is an INCREDIBLY selfish thing for me to even be worried about right now, obviously my top priority is making sure my boyfriend is healthy and safe and alive. But this still has me a bit worried. I love my boyfriend very much, we talk about marriage often, and aside from his drug use I think we have a very healthy relationship. I would be so crushed if he came out of rehab and suddenly didn't want to be with me anymore because some counselor had put that thought in his head. I understand that part of recovery involves avoiding certain triggers, and that addicts are often encouraged to end toxic friendships and get rid of possessions that remind them of drug use, so if he truly needed to break up with me because being with me reminded him of cocaine then of course I'd be willing to make that sacrifice. But oh boy would it hurt.

1645,addiction,2020/04/14,"non-mainstream addictions Ever since I've managed to overcome my addiction, I've been feeling like some kind of outcast, like I wasn't an OG. Why is that? Well, because I'm not addicted to opiates or alcohol. I'm addicted to an MMO video game called World of Warcraft. It all started when I got my first computer as a kid, and lasted for the last 12 years, throughout my entire education. It basically ruined my entire life: I've failed high school, wasted literally thousands of dollars, made a suicide attempt, started having problems with my back (sitting for 15 hours straight every day isn't the best for your back :d) Happily, these days are gone, but it wasn't an easy road. Hours of therapy, relapses, trying to find a meaning in life, which felt incredibly empty, sometimes still does. I'm going through the same shit every other addict does: constant scare of relapsing, missing the ""fantastic"" times when I used to play for days with only taking breaks for a breakfast, fighting with myself each day. 

And yet I still feel like I'm not worthy to be a part of the community. Like my addiction is a piece of cake compared to what those addicted to benzos or alcohol had to overcome. But the only difference is the physical aspect - at least that's what it seems like.

What's even worse is the fact, that I'm not the only one, who feels that way. The entire society warns about benzodiazepines or opiates, but nobody really talks about all other addictions, which can tear lives apart. These addictions seem to be very abstract to people. Try telling someone that you are an recovering alcoholic - the reaction will be wonderful. Then tell another person, that you've struggled with porn addiction - they probably won't be too enthusiastic.

What I am trying to say is basically not to underestimate the success of those, who recovered - no matter what they were addicted to. Show as much love to these people, as you would show to alcoholics and drug addicts - we all know they need it. 

Oh, and I hope that nobody will get angry because of this post, I just mean that we are all equal - no matter what we are fighting with. If you've managed to quit anything that was bad for you, be proud of yourself. Had to get this off my chest.",414,0.0,0,0.0

The doctor instantly put me on Adderall, and we slowly worked our way up to 20 mg per day XR. From November 2019 to March 2020, I was taking 20 mg every single day.

It worked really well. So many of the symptoms I once had were taken care of. It was incredible!

The one thing I am worried about is Adderall's addiction potential. Schedule II drugs are not a laughing matter. For the first time, I went off of Adderall 18 days ago to see if I had any withdrawal symptoms. I haven't taken it in 18 days.

For the first 7-8 days of this, I literally couldn't stay awake through the day. I would get really tired from not having taken Adderall that I had to take a long nap mid-day. That eventually went away though.

I've reached a point where I can say I have a problem and I need to seek help.  have an addiction to MDMA and weed. I'm a 35 year old male, I'm an IT consultant by profession and my wife is a doctor. 

I was introduced to it by my wife when we were still dating. 

We are fresh into our marriage (2 years) but we have known each other for over a decade. Luckily she still has a job but I have no been able to find anything and I've hit a quite a depressing low. I have been laid off for a year and a half now and it's been tough on my mental state. I started using mdma and smoking pot a lot while being laid off to cope with my sad moods all the time.

I feel like absolute shit that i let it get this bad (or even start), while my wife is slaving away Im getting fucked up at home.  feel pathetic. I don't want to tell her in fear of ruining my marriage so I am reaching out here.

I want to do better for my wife. Please offer me some wisdom.

1656,addiction,2020/04/14,"Recent Cocaine Relapse: 3 Questions (Long post imo) Some background, I recently completed a 3 1/2 Month 12 Step Treatment program in late 2019 and have since relapsed just after getting my 8 months clean, then a month went by and I just finished my worse bender ever. I currently live with the person I relapsed with (he was clean for 9 or 10 months as well). Sorry in advance for the grammar..

Question 1:

What alternatives are out there for Programs besides the 12 Steps?

I had a some good progress with some of the Steps, Steps 4 and 5 were eye opening, and Step 10 has been helpful but overall I couldn't  get behind believing in the spirituality aspect of the throughout the 12 steps. Hell I got into arguments in group several times and almost left a couple times as I felt the spirituality part was being shoved down my throat as an aesthetic plus I'm stubborn as a mule. I'm thinking I need to start attending meetings again, find activities to keep my busy, and communicate with people  who care are in my life. I'm not sure if I do another 3 to 4 month program again at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Question 2:

Should I move out? I'm on the fence about it.  I think I just need to have a good heart to heart with him about everything before giving up on our friendship.

Question 3:

Should I tell my parents? 

They are a huge part of my life, and I discovered through therapy (before going to Treatment) that when they moved away to retire that it was one of my many triggers that started my addiction with drugs. They were heart broken when I first told them I had problem before going to rehab but they have been as supportive as they from across the country. The main reason I don't want to tell them is because they already worry about me 24/7, think I'm going die everyday even before I relapsed, they have no trust in me. As I'm typing out my reasoning, I think their just excuses and I'm more afraid than anything of losing them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for suggestions and to hear from people about experiences with their relapses and what they did to recover. 

Before I started writing this post I had a bunch of questions, which I now can't think of. Hell I even feel better after writing all this out to be honest. Thanks in advance!",430,0.0,0,0.0

I am in desperate need of help or advice. I’ve gotten myself into some shit and I’m at a loss on how to fix myself.

I’ll try to keep it short and to the point.

A couple of months ago, I got myself hooked on opioids. I went from 10 mg a day for a few months, to 50 mg a day for a month and I am trying so desperately to quit. I’m currently taking about 10 mg a day to wean off of it. 

This is something that I am absolutely not able to share with anyone except for my best friend. 

I am SO ready to leave this all behind but I have  failed all of my previous attempts at stopping. I’m scared, I borderline can’t handle the feeling of withdrawal. The restless nights, the unbearable anxiety, the loss of joy in everything. People I’ve talked to said you just have to push through but I’m just not strong enough. 

Rehab isn’t an option, but I would go willingly if I could. 

Please, any advice, any words of encouragement, any past experiences that you can share with me to help me. I am desperate..

1663,addiction,2020/04/14,"Girlfriend is relapsing after social distancing order I've been with my girlfriend for the last 2 or so years and she had a bit of cocaine problem when we first started dating that progressively got worse. Over the course of our relationship, I helped her get sober and she's been (mostly) sober for the vast majority of our relationship, but now with the social distancing orders I'm afraid that's ruined all her progress and I just don't know what to do. 

Because of COVID 19, I've essentially moved back into my parent's house to take care of them. They're elderly and at-risk so I moved in to take care of them for the time being. My girlfriend's sister moved in with her (she's 14 and was in boarding school), so we've been apart for most of the social distancing order. She's out of a job now so I was worried she'd get bored and eventually relapse,  but because her little sister's with her I figured everything would be okay...I was wrong. 

Sadly there's reason to believe that she's relapsing and she's now started to lie about her drug use. She'll go missing for days, won't answer her phone, and when I call her sister she'll tell me that my girlfriend was sleeping all day and hasn't been out of her room. When I ask my girlfriend what's going on she'll make up a bunch of lame excuses and wouldn't be honest. She eventually broke down and told me she did cocaine for a few nights and that she ran out so she won't be doing it again, but then she disappeared for another 2 days and another. It's just not looking good. 

If she is relapsing then I understand and I want to be there for her, but I can't take much more of the lying. I've made that much clear to her. We struggled together to get her sober the first time and I understand the relapse at this particular stage in her life.  There's a lot going on and she needed an escape. I'll struggle to sober her up again if necessary, but I just need her to stop lying to me. 

I'm on the brink and I'm afraid. I'm thinking about leaving her. I just don't trust her anymore and every time she lies I feel like she's spitting in my face. If I do leave her I'm worried about might happen. We almost broke up years ago (early into our relationship) and she threatened suicide, while there's no reason to believe that'll happen, it's still a fear in the back of my mind. If I do leave her I also worry that she'll just go on a coke binge now knowing that there's no one she'll need to sober up and respond to. I love her and want to help, but I can't take much more of the deception and lying and now I feel trapped. What the hell do I do?",541,1.0,4,0.0073937153419593345

It’s the period of time AFTER acute withdrawal (2 weeks after stopping the use of drugs/alcohol). 
 PAWS can last up to two years after last use of drugs/alcohol. 
A few of the Symptoms include: 

Feeling like you can’t feel emotion OR feeling like your emotions are “raw”. 

Having a hard time feeling things like shame or love. 

Sleep problems- too little or too much/ sleeping at the wrong times

Problems with coordination- running into things by accident, being clumsy

Memory impairment- short term or long term memory lapses. Trouble retaining new info 

And more....

I started lying to friends, teachers, family, strangers etc. And I felt like shit but couldn't stop.
I felt awful, I feel awful some of my friendships are built on lies and I cant come to terms with telling them that I've been lying this entire time. I've stopped talking about the made up friends, I've stopped logging into the made up profiles of people who dont exist and I've managed to catch myself in a lie a few times.

During these four years, it has been in-between ‘at least one joint for the day’ and at most, well can’t count that, can we? Even after this lockdown started, weed and work-from-home were going hand-in-hand.

1682,addiction,2020/04/15,"I’m addicted to television. Please help. I know it’s not as serious as other substances, like drugs and alcohol, but it has ruined my life. I wake up, watch, eat, watch, sleep, repeat. I would even watch while peeing/pooing and while bathing (I rarely take showers and usually baths now to watch) AND EVEN WHILE IM DOING HOMEWORK AND STUDYING. My day revolved around watching as much as possible. 

I craved TV starting around 8-9 years old. However my parents were able to put restrictions and I had an active imagination so I would play with my friends and toys. As I grew older, I found ways to go around these restrictions, especially with YouTube and how I would spiral down videos for hours. 

Soon I realized I would be angry while conversing with others because I wasn’t watching TV. I would take it out on my friends and family. Soon, my I became friendless and I alienated myself from my family. 

I used to be a grade A+ student until junior year of high school, the most important year for college. I would watch ALL THE TIME, and I soon began getting Bs and Cs. It cost me my track to a great college. 

I also realized in social gatherings, I felt as though I was putting on a mask to fit in. I acted in a way that did not reflect my personality mostly because I did not know how I would respond. I felt emotionless. I don’t feel human anymore. 

I have told my parents about it, but they say something along the lines of “just stop” or “do something else.” When I’m watching and they tell me to do something more productive or more fulfilling, I would make excuses and lie, saying I was doing a lot of work or something. That’s why I’m here haha. 

The problem is, I love TV and movies. It makes me feel great joy, laugh, and really think about certain topics. Some of my fondest memories, sadly, are watching Avatar the Last Airbender (a show I want to show my children if I can find someone to love and who loves me), laughing while watching Parks and Rec, the Office, and Community, and cheering while watching Marvel movies and contemplating societal infrastructure after watching Parasite. Furthermore, TV and movies are engrained in culture, like the phenomenon with Game of Thrones and Avengers Endgame. I know it is ruining my life, and I’m not doing anything meaningful with my life, but I truly love watching TV and movies. But do I really enjoy it if I experience such pain when I’m not watching?

I was introduced to coke just over a year ago through my bf and have been using maybe up to 4 times a month, typically long into the night. I don’t know exactly how much I use but would say I do 2-3 lines an hour for up to 8 hours at most sometimes. I’d say half the times I’ve used I was drinking as well which I know is terrible. Last July (6 months into this type of use) I had an ECG done as part of another checkup and my doctor said there was something unusual about the result, something about q-waves. She said they sometimes see that in people who have had a heart attack but I haven’t had one so she said she wouldn’t worry too much. I didn’t think too much of it and my specialist who was supposed to review the result seemed to have forgot to bring it up during my appointment and she’s retired now. (I am also terrified of bringing this up to any doctors for fear of discrimination from future healthcare providers. I’m in a helping field and may want to do post-grad but don’t know if future employers have the right to have access to drug use history.)

I am in a state of panic right now because I’m reading more about coke and heart damage. While I knew it was a huge risk, because I wasn’t using daily I didn’t think it would catch up to me like this. A few days ago I was laughing really hard about something (like a can’t catch my breath type of laugh) and noticed a sort of pressure or pulling on the left side of my chest which eventually dissipated after I stopped laughing and calmed down. This is when I became especially concerned. I looked into anginas and it seems like this could potentially be one except the ache was only in a specific area centre-left of my chest and I didn’t have the pain that supposedly goes down the left arm or anywhere else.

Can someone please tell me if any damage I could have caused is reversible? Does it sound like I could have a heart attack any moment? I know I’m an idiot, know I need to stop.

I'm not at the legal drinking age in my country yet, but it won't be long. I'm seriously worried for myself. I have no self-discipline and seem to be maybe prone to addiction. 

I do have interests that I want to pursue - I seriously love reading philosophy and psychology and talking about them - but I don't have a clear goal in mind and wouldn't feel too horrible if I had to give these things up to live mindlessly.

My own consciousness scares and deeply pains me. I feel the urge to eliminate it. I fear this will also push me towards becoming dependent on some substance/behavior or another.

The hardest part is not having anything to do, and I know I'm not supposed to be a mind reader, but I'm pretty sure that's what's making most of us struggle (judging by some of your amazing posts). All I have to say is start working on finding yourself through 12 step working and try rekindling with those who matter (please stay indoors and safe or maintain safe distancing). I've been closer with my family than ever before and they are scattered throughout the country! Coming clean to them when I popped was a real wake up call. 

The best part about losing everything is learning how to work up to becoming better through the experience. I may be losing my job now, but through this sober experience and knowing I'll forever be an addict is one hell of an adventure only a few of us can share! I want to be somebody! I wasted too much time being a stoner or too high to feel my teeth or too drunk to remember who I was. for too long was I caught up on self victimizing and playing a pity party. That only feeds the addiction! 

Even if people call me a loser or talk smack about me, I know I'm working on becoming better than I ever was, and that's something nobody has over me!

1695,addiction,2020/04/16,"The biggest regret of addiction Hey all, 
I thought I’d just share my thoughts on how I’m feeling in regards to my past addictions 
So I was essentially a drug addict since I was very young (started at twelve years of age) 
It first started smoking weed and drinking with my mates and over the years turned into basically every drug other than meth and heroin. I left school when I was fifteen and got a full time job and would work six days a week and would blow the whole pay check on a cocktail of drugs, this went on up until I was twenty years old and decided one day I’ve had enough and quit everything that same day.
I’ve been sober for a very long time but one thing I regret is going out with friends to have a good night and watch them pull out a bag of coke or mdma mid way through and see them enjoying themselves with no toxic history behind it and genuinely just have fun in the moment and wake up the next day with no thought of taking more for months knowing if that was me I’d be calling my dealer the next morning for more. 
Sometimes I’ll be visiting my brothers for dinner and a movie and they will pull out a joint to lighten up the mood and knowing I can’t participate because one joint never stays to just one joint. 
Honestly all the money spent over the years all the moments in life I missed to do drugs all the relationships I ruined I got past but I genuinely wish i could just clear any memory of my previous addiction and be able to just take substance once a year just to have a good time but clearly that will never be the case. It feels great to be sober and actually have a savings account or be able to take things seriously and be taken seriously but every now and then it would be nice to just just roll up a joint put my feet up and just drift off for a few hours. 
Any way I’d love any advice or others to share their experiences as it always helps to hear from others than are also in the same boat

&amp;#x200B;

For context, I'm three years and some change clean from Meth. I live in Florida but I went to New Jersey for rehab, stayed there for almost three years and on September 2019 I moved back home to Florida. Been living with my parents since I got here and co-habituating has been mostly smooth sailing. I have a good relationship with them, we hang out, I go fishing with my dad, watch movies and then I lead a pretty robust social life with good friends. I've been gainfully employed for the last three years, got a job as soon as I moved back to Florida and never missed a day in the 7 months at my ""new"" job. I got laid off due to COVID-19 about three weeks ago and my sleep schedule has gone to shit. I stay up all night bullshitting on Skype with online friends, fall asleep around 8 AM and then wake up around 4 or 5, rinse repeat. Additionally out of the last two checks I've received since being laid off, I've given my father $700 dollars to help out with groceries and the mortgage. He's an independent contractor and I don't want him out, working more than he actually needs and potentially exposing himself to the virus.

I was just watching TV in my room and I walked out to the kitchen to get a drink and my parents were like ""Are you okay? We are seriously concerned about you... we are seeing a lot of red flags. You don't want to hang out with us, you sleep all day. You haven't cut your hair.""Pretty much accusing me of a relapse and it's just really frustrating because at the base of it... there's nothing wrong except the fact that I'm furloughed, really bored, and there's nothing to fucking do. I've been respecting social distancing (more than I actually would if I was living on my own) because they are elderly and I don't want to put their health at risk.Anyway, we kind of went back and forth but I was so frustrated that I was having trouble really articulating just how offended and frustrated their line of questioning was. I guess it stems from the fact that they're very ignorant and uneducated when it comes to substance abuse. If I was shooting up crystal meth in my room, I wouldn't be in this damn house. I would be out, running around, doing chaotic addict things.

Fuck, it really rubbed me the wrong way and I'm so incredibly mad. I never thought that I could be this mad at them in the good head space I am and have been in. I know it came from a place of caring and concern -- but sometimes I feel like... are we ever going to get past this? It's been 3+ years, are they ever going to fully trust me? I know I put the family through it, but like, even during active addiction nobody in the family had it worse than me. I never stole from them, never asked for money, when I started going off the rails I removed myself from their lives completely as to not drag them into my bullshit, I never lost my temper with them... I just removed myself from the family and then sent myself to rehab, by my own choice (and kind of out of the blue) when I decided I'd had enough.

I know that there is very little of substance and this post and there's nothing anyone can \*really\* say...but I just had to let it out because I'm completely and absolutely fuming right now. I don't like being that guy that's like ""Yeah, this conversation is over"" but it's what I literally just had to do with them. I had to put a pin in it because we are 3 years and some change into sobriety and me turning my life around. Accusations or insinuations that I've relapsed because my sleep schedule is funky and I'm not as peppy as I normally am during a global pandemic is just kind of really fucking lame and unfair.  I can't even come around to like a gentle, ""I understand your concern"" stance because I'm just so incredibly... angry right now.

I don’t even know why. I was diagnosed with ADD (also having CPTSD, but realized it last year) and took it several years without being addicted- more like the opposite. 
And now I can’t stop taking too much even though it makes me feel worse and I know it. And it’s not even making me feel high, or like a having a lot of energy, never did. Every time I read about students using it to stay awake or have more energy or stuff like that, I get kinda jealous because in my case it made me clean up my room when I first got it prescribed. 
And then it teared down many layers of dissociation, false beliefs and illusions I had to create during my life to cope with the traumatic experiences I experienced in my family and school. 

But now it became the only controllable instance in my life and the irony is, I can’t even control it. It feels more like a psychological addiction, because I get extremely afraid, when I don’t take it. It feels like a frame that brings me somehow through the day. 
Before that it was binging food, and other things that are still haunting me, like skin picking, binge watching and now smoking.

It got even worse and I am terrified that all the trauma and stuff that came up when I started the medication , even though I used it correctly except the past two years, is all my fault due to abusing the medication. 
It doesn’t even make me feel good and it’s like I am addicted to destroy myself, but I’d rather torture me with that, than to sit and wait for what is trying to overwhelm me when I don’t run away. 

I am ashamed, I feel like trash and that everything is my fault and nothing ever happened to me and I just got crazy because of substance abuse. 
I want to disappear and hide and run away from my existence. I can’t endure what I try to avoid so much that I use this as means of escape. 

I feel too close to the core of my anxiety that I feel like I go mad when I don’t try to escape or dissociate. 
It feels like I am dissolving and falling uncontrollable without something to hold on to. No safety no secure ground, I would rather die than to feel this because I can’t imagine something more horrific than to feel this solitude, abandonment, pain, darkness, panic and deadly terror.

1712,addiction,2020/04/17,"Nicotine and weed use a problem, starting to need harder drugs to feel anything :/ I’m 18M in the us and like a lot of people my age I vape, I have been for two years now and it never seemed like a serious problem until recently. I don’t eat until the hunger start to hurt my stomach and I don’t feel the effects of nicotine at all anymore yet I still crave the drug. I also get massive headaches for hours everyday.  I’ve been smoking weed about a year but I now use multiple times a day every day and can barely feel effects anymore. I have very bad anxiety and depression, I used to take anti depressants and they made me feel awful. At some point I figured out if I smoked whenever I felt stressed or like I was going to freak out I’d feel way better. About 9 months ago my depression was bad, rarely left my bed room, slept through the day, so my parents gave me an ambien once to help me sleep just a couple hours earlier to get back to a normalish sleep schedule. I didn’t fall asleep, I stayed awake through the effects and it felt amazing. I managed to steal more, and had used it and eventually forgot about it. 

A while back I stole some more, and now that I can’t really feel the effects of the drugs I use I feel like I almost crave how I felt on ambien. I have held onto the two I stole for almost two months just thinking about using them, unable to get rid of them with my own self will. Every high I’ve felt I feel I always crave it again, whether it’s being drunk, high, buzzed, or whatever, I always want more and I want it stronger. 

I’ve never had a serious problem with a hard drug but I feel I might fall into it, and my current use of nicotine and weed is already really unhealthy. I’d ultimately like to quit nicotine because I realize even when I take a break for a day to feel the effects, it still takes a ton of holding in big hits to feel anything, to the point where it makes me so sick I cannot even stand. I do like weed and understand healthy use is fine but I need to learn what that’s like. I don’t know what to do, I know quitting nicotine is a nearly impossible task, I will always crave it and it’s way too easy for me to get. Eventually I’ll run out of weed (quarantine) and I’m afraid I’ll end up taking the ambien as the only thing stopping me now is that it’s in my car. 

I don’t know what to do or how to go about not ruining my own life by continuing to believe it isn’t a big deal, because I fear it’ll become one.",515,1.0,1,0.001941747572815534

I dated a guy I met 15 years ago, for about 8 years. We split a while ago. It didn’t end well (cheating, abuse etc) and that was that. The way things ended and how he acted made me worried he was on drugs (he had always used something like weed or coke) but something was different. He seemed in deep. I could tell because he didn’t have a conscious. He was cold. 

Anyways we didn’t talk for a long time. He jumped into another relationship overlapping ours and he had a kid so I let him be. He ends up splitting from her and we see each other once. He seems in DEEP. He’s been using heroine and meth. He’s skinny, manic, broke etc all things he never was before. 

He moved out of state and that’s when things got bad. He moved to Vegas and I have only heard from him once when he asked me to check on a family friend for him and I found out that person was giving him money so he wanted to make sure they were alive. I found this out when I went to check on them and they told me they had been giving him money. I was so angry he used me for that. That was it after that. 

I did get a call about him last year from the highway patrol from our state but I told them I didn’t have his phone number any longer. Which was true. 

I had a bad dream about him the other day. We were in a casino but I had an unsettling feeling about him. 

A few days after my dream I found out he’s being accused of a homicide and it happened outside a casino (weird). It looks like a set up and there is a lot of mounting evidence (and witnesses). Along with that he has serious drug charges against him (heroine possession and distributing) and weapon charges... 

I just can’t believe this. I’m so sad. I feel I’m grieving him. The addict part is what I can’t get over. I tried to help him so many times and he never wanted help. Ever. He wanted to live this rotten life and keep pushing the envelope and be above the law 

He has a child he hasn’t seen in years to or even called, and he’s probably facing a long time in jail if not life.

My older brother has been an opiate addict for about 15 years. He's turning 30 next month. He's been with his girlfriend for the majority of their addiction, probably almost 10 years now. In the last 6ish years i've had to help my mom kick him out of her home. The two of them had an apartment for a short while before my brother got picked up by the police. My mother and I went to his apartment to make sure it was locked up and we found a younger couple staying there and had to kick them out. They were clearly using, the apartment was a mess. He relapsed about a year ago on my mothers birthday, I told him I would drive him down to the nearest inpatient program. He refused.

I moved out of my moms, moved to a town an hour away. My brother and his girlfriend soon moved back in with my mom. Things were mostly okay and they were seriously working on finding jobs and a home, then he relapsed again. She gave him a chance and he didn't improve, so she told them they had to leave. They did. They found jobs though and have been working at them for about 2 months now.

Then this pandemic happened. They didnt have reliable housing and their job told them they could keep working from home if they found something reliable. So my mom allowed them to move back in, save a bit of money, and find a place in a few weeks. Things were good for a time.

I just got off the phone with her and its maybe the worst its ever been. My mom has put up with a lot of gaslighting and manipulation from the two of them. She's been out of work so they've contributed some more of their pay to help her while she waits for unemployment. They seem to be holding that above her head. They havent been leaving the house except for the store across the street so it seems like my brother is abusing his medication that he's been given multiple weeks of on account of the pandemic.

My moms had to turn off the breaker to the stove as she's found them passed out with it on in the middle of the night. His girlfriend's stumbled into my mom's room in the middle of the night in confusion. My mom doesn't feel safe.

I realize this stuff needs to be handled with as much compassion as we can summon. A week or two before the pandemic hit I wrote my brother a long letter, saying that I worry every day about having to take care of this family on my own if he fell deeper or even died. I tried to be as compassionate, but honest as I could, and I felt like it would be my last attempt for now to reach him. He hasn't said anything about and told my mom that I hate him after he read it. We're a poor family, my mother's has a disability that I am sure has been exacerbated with this decade and a half of stress and heartbreak. I wish I could just throw some money around to get him in treatment for as long as he needed so he could at least get a glimpse of life outside of his addiction. But we just cant. I just need him to leave our mom be before he overdoses in her home (he's been drinking with his pills as well) or she has a heart attack from the stress.

So I considered driving there today or tomorrow, and calmly telling them they had to leave. But my mom is worried that they would try to file a civil suit against her evicting them. That's fair considering they have, at multiple points, tried to claim squatters rights other times she's tried kicking them out (they eventually left every time and didnt actually bring it to court). So instead I suggested talking to him over the phone today, whenever he wakes up and hopefully before he starts using.

But I dont really know what to say. I want to say that either he's going to die or she is if this continues like this. I want to tell him how ungrateful it is to be given yet another chance at having a home at least and a way to keep his job, only to fall back into this and treat his mother this way.

I know only I know what I'll be able to say. You don't know the entire picture even if i sat here writing for hours. I just need some advice, thoughts anyone might have. I'm worried about turning my brother out onto the street in this climate. But I feel we've exhausted ever chance to get him clean at home, and I want my mom to be okay and safe and comfortable without having to worry about my brother going through withdrawals and whatever else.

At the very least I wanted to get these thoughts out. Even if you don't have advice I'd appreciate hearing from anyone who's felt any of this, on any side.

As a parent, I struggle with the line between letting the adult child suffer and assisting. Not that there is a perfect equation. Two of my children used the assistance to bounce to self-sustaining careers and emotional stability. The other one, well, the path hasn't been so clear. 

The grey area, as I like to refer to it, between teenage years and adulthood didn't work our so well for my middle son. He emerged from it with some powerful addictions. He lost most of the decade to heroin. Naive to the realities of addiction, I thought I could solve the problem. I couldn't. He ended up back on the street, sleeping in a car, and feeding his addiction.

Three years later, he returned. I only saw him a handful of times in the intervening years. I attended all his court hearings. I new about his arrests because he would call begging for bail (I never bailed him out). 

One night he came back broken, hungry, and tired (and under the influence). He heard about a medication that helped people get off opioids and wanted to try. I held his hand through the first several days to clear his system of heroin so he could begin taking Suboxone--a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone. The medication has worked well (that was October).

Here's the problem. While I'm pretty certain he is clean, his life is stalled. Those grey years of primary development were missed. Normal adult behaviors appear missing. Motivation gone. We work on baby steps, and he is progressing, but full recovery doesn't appear in the immediate future. Have any of you experienced successful prolonged recoveries? What works? How long did it take?

Through the years there have been times when I have been so completely hooked on this game that I lose all track of who I am without it. I’ve spent months on end housebound because of this game. I’ve neglected school, relationships, work, and myself because of it. My sleeping schedule was completely reversed and I didn’t see sunlight for weeks at a time. I showered once a week. I ate one meal a day. My hair would fall out and I would lose so much weight. It was awful, lonely shit and a bad coping mechanism for my real life situation. 

I finally managed to get my shit together by quitting cold turkey a few years ago, but now that COVID is around I though I could handle it and it would only be for a few hours a day, and it would only be because I have nothing else to do, and excuse on top of excuse on top of excuse.

We talk here and there and a bit more in the past few weeks.

He was nonsensical, saying I betrayed him, he wished he’d never met me, etc. He even commented on my old friends Instagram accounts that have photos of me.

As the tittle says my mom is end stage cancer and is in home hospice. She’s stopped drinking water so it won’t be long. 

For months I’ve suspected my father has been taking opioids again. He’s a recovering alcoholic 30 years ago and about 15 years ago overcame an opioid addiction after being in pain management for shoulder surgeries. 

Since then he’s picked up smoking pot which my mother hated but put up with because she was done confronting him. It was Just a little before bed. But as you can imagine it got worse as my mom got sicker. 

The past few months he appeared to be back on pills. He denied it when I talked to him and I chalked it up to stress and over use of pot. We talked to a therapist and he felt better. He opened up to me and told me how hard it was being an addict and how he was dealing with it. Things seemed to be better so I didn’t put much thought into it. 

Now that my mom is on hospice I moved back in with my dad sister and mom to help out. 

We’ve always had a great relationship but he’s been increasingly agitated and picks small fights with me regularly. He’s very fragile. Move one thing in him. Or clean something he wasn’t ready to clean and he gets angry. It’s very hard to deal with. I had some reason to suspect again he was on pills. 

While he was sleeping I counted my moms oxy script and counted 19 pills. 

Last night he was out cold sleeping (how he used to when he used) and I counted again and there were 17. 

This morning 16. 

I don’t know what to do next.

1749,addiction,2020/04/19,"I’m almost 3 months sober from alcohol. Hi, 

I’m an alcoholic and I have been for the past decade. I am now 25 and this is the longest I have ever been sober. I can’t remember being sober this long from alcohol. I woke up in hospitals, I would start fights with people because I was angry inside, I would get more depressed and anxious when I would wake up the next day. Thinking what I did last night - if someone touched me or not or how did I get home... especially as a young woman this is horrifying to experience. 

I knew I needed to stop because it was damaging my health overall. I was tired of waking up the next day feeling sick, puking out my guts, eating hangover food like McDonald’s to help me. After a heavily binge of 4-5 days the weekend would roll around and I would force myself to drink despite my body rejecting it. I would drink it until I got tipsy and it didn’t happen anymore. 

I don’t know if it’s my genetics because I’m Indigenous but alcohol effects me more? It’s like poison to us.. my family doesn’t drink and they feel uncomfortable of me drinking..

I’m a young woman that struggled with social anxiety since I was fifteen. The “great” liquid courage gave me confidence to talk to people but at the end of the night it would usually be a sloppy blacked out mess..

I’m almost 3 months sober and I cannot remember the last time I stopped for this long. 

It’s like whenever the 11th hits I forget and I get emotional and think about myself becoming sober..

I want to become more physically fit, further my education, be a role model for others.....

I thought about it today.. seeing people drinking during this quarantine.. I kind of miss it but when I really think for a moment I think it’s not worth it. I’m sick and tired of that feeling that fucking face hitting a pole, waking up in hospitals, losing my shit, waking up with random shit, not remembering arguments with my mother, passing out at a festival due to dehydration, getting hit by a car, not remembering that I was trying to steal someone’s girl (lol), arguing with everyone that comes near me kind of fucking hangover. 

I’m still struggling as I still think about it and I’m not sure if I’ll ever drink again or not. But right now thinking about it.. reminds me of the disgusting feeling of being up for 2 days no sleep of drinking... i still see young people like myself do it and I get jealous...

I went sober to foster a life of healthy behaviors and relationships that didn't have facades between myself and other people.

1753,addiction,2020/04/19,"So embarrassed to admit I'm addicted to Loperamide but here I am and need help. Who gets addicted to diarrhea medicine right? Well, this person did. I used it to cover up withdrawal feeling and symptoms from the Vicodin I used to take for all of my pelvic pain and lower back pain. I am a 28F. The thing is, I think if I was addicted to Vicodin, it would be easier to seek help from my doctor, my husband (who is an MD, ironic) my incredible parents and my loving sister but who wants to go to their loved ones and admit they're addicted to Loperamide AKA the poor mans methadone. I feel so embarrassed and ashamed. Since my start is in lockdown and I would be home all day every day for almost a month, also working from home, I would try and detox and get off this medication once and for all but every time I try, I fail. I don't have kids so I do have the luxury of locking myself in my bedroom and telling everyone to leave me alone and not to get in my way. 

My very sweet and loving husband has no clue. Not one. I'm an incredible liar when it comes to this. I choke up withdrawal into ""I'm just having severe anxiety today so that's why I don't like to be touched, held onto, grumpy, irritated and well, have horrible anxiety. 

I am starting a brand new job that I am very excited about very soon - But I am terrified in the same sense of my loperamide addiction will affect my brand new job just as my vicodin/loperamide addiction has consumed me at the job I'm about to quit at which is 4.5 years.

I'm running out of quarantine time and I have to get past at least the first week. If I can make it 5-7 days, I think that will be enough for me to keep moving and I'll just have to remind my husband it's just anxiety and this happens.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can deal with this at home? My husband wants to help but I don't dare tell him what's going on, mostly because during that withdrawal, if he starts asking me all these questions (like the doctor he is) I will get so irate and irritation with the back and forth talking that I'll push him away and I'm terrified I'll push him out my life for just trying to help me. Any advice on what to stock up on? I do take Alprazolam for anxiety but I'm afraid to take it during this withdrawal to help it and then if I give up and have to start over, I'll essentially have to be without my anxiety meds for maybe two weeks before they're re-filled and I don't want to waste them.

Thank you everyone for your time, this was a short rant telling a story and looking for advice and I'm sorry this was so random but I just needed to put it down somewhere.

I think of and pray for everyone in any type of similar situation every single night hoping others are doing the same for me.

So here are some thought process I've been using for awhile to help me not relapse.

1. Accepting how you feel
First we have to understand that right now maybe we have an urge and we feel like shit but we know doing our drug of choice is going to give us our instant gratification and make us feel good. That's all our mind is thinking about ""i feel like shit I want to feel good! Make me feel good"" But, what if I just sit right here on my ass and do nothing? It remains just a thought. So I am going to accept that I am going to feel like shit for what, a few minutes? An hour? At most a day? As long as I don't put action behind that thought I'm fine! 

2. Futuring
So. What happens if i do it? Fast forward (BLRRRRRRP) *vcr noise*. You get your instant gratification and get done feeling good then what happens? Not only are their the negative consequences that effect everything and everyone around you but guess what...*hello darkness my old friend*. That's right YOU FEEL LIKE SHIT AGAIN. Not only do you feel like shit again but you feel even WORSE than you did before because you failed to keep a promise you made to yourself. 

If you take one thing from this, don't be full of shit. Especially to yourself",297,1.0,1,0.003367003367003367

1762,addiction,2020/04/20,"Weed+Gaming+Love Hello redditers,

I’ll try to describe the rather difficult situation I am in as short as I can... Well, I (32) live about a year now with my partner (36) a heavy cannabis smoker (about 6-7 joints on daily basis) with successive gaming habits since his childhood. “Successive” meaning he plays daily about 7-8 hours DOTA when I am in home-office mode, when I am not at home he plays… until I come back. Please keep reading :D

I knew he was a gamer and smoked of course before we moved together, but I didn’t realize the whole situation. However, after a year of long distance relationship he immigrated to the country I live: he wanted to be with me and develop his career. I believe that his work until then (a crazy well paid home-office job in an international organization) helped him “cultivate” and establish his habits… seeming normal to the rest of the world: He would work only a few (5-6) days per month and earn fcking lot of money for the average wage there. As he came here, he kept of course his home-office work just to have a backup and search for the vacancies here, learn the language etc… And after a year here he did exactly… nothing. He didn’t even meet another person except my friends and his dealer. Really. Writing this I realize again how crazy this is. At first he said it was the time for integration he needed, then it was the summer-holiday season, afterwards came my pressure and my questions “ehm don’t you play too much?” that destructed him… then it was suddenly Christmas… now you can imagine what happens with the lockdown. 

Now everytime I confront the situation he persuades me in the end with his charm and intelligence, that a big part of this situation is my fault: he moved because of me in a city he didn’t want to, he knows nobody here and I was a monster who was always criticising him and didn’t support enough. And from time to time I sink in the depression that somebody who lives with a person like this sinks and feel completely devastated, thinking I did all wrong and I really didn’t support him…

I believe there are a lot of people here, that in one way or another are in similar situations, so we can maybe brainstorm a bit together? Is there any possibility to support a person, who is in complete denial about stopping? In the beginning he was lying to me and his friends who tried to intervate, now he says that he wants to build a functional life and REDUCE the hours and the joints (but not stop for a period and detox) though he has no input except 9gag and YouTube, no hobbies except his computer and found his new explanation, that it is the fault of his girlfriend?

\*Of course I tried already the suggestion to go to therapy, even as a couple, and the answers are balancing between laughing me out about trying to help, “you don’t understand the situation” and “I cannot afford this” or “I need to solve other things before, like career etc”. But still, do you have positive experience with therapy (or no therapy) in this field?

1763,addiction,2020/04/20,"Online Gambling Addiction On my 16th birthday, I was given $100 by my family members to enjoy my freedom and do whatever I wished with this money.  Your imagination takes control of you and clouds your logical thinking. Regardless I went to a bitcoin atm in my nearby area to find out you had to be over 18, I was extremely disappointed. I then bought a $100 amazon gift card and traded it for bitcoin on [localbitcoins.com](https://localbitcoins.com/). For some reason, I had a mindset where I knew I could get scammed but had an all or nothing mentality which should have been a warning sign for further reckless behavior.  I was watching videos learning more about the technology and somehow stumbled upon a video that showed a site called bitsler where you could instantly deposit and win crypto. I watched a video where this guy seamlessly deposited a similar amount that I had and won $8000 within minutes. I deposited my money and became a sucker that day. I just kept doubling up after every loss and chased losses. I lost patience with small bets and strategies. I ended up winning 20 litecoins which was over $1000 and I was shocked. I instantly withdrew them to my own wallet, knowing full well that they would be returning to the site later after the rush I received. The next night those litecoins were once again being gambled, now I had a more exaggerated fantasy of my possible winnings. I thought I was some genius who would bet a large amount on black after many consecutive reds, I was so overconfident I probably would have claimed it as being skill rather than luck. I get jittery even thinking about my previous bets, losing 15 litecoins on a 50% bet. I was so desensitized by the ""number on the screen"" rather than actual cash. Of course, I doubled up losing bets and got lucky. I remember my heart beating so fast and my hands shaking typing in chat before I went all-in with 93 litecoins all or nothing on 2.1x payout. Parents sitting in the room 20 feet away completely unaware of what I am doing.... starting an unhealthy addiction and unrealistic perception of digital money and gambling. I don't know whether it was good or bad that I won that bet. Sometimes I wish I had just lost it all here. At the time I won litecoin was around $60 a piece. I would always consider not going to my job paying $13/hr because I just made a week's worth of pay in 10 minutes, it was like having an unimaginable ""superpower"" of being able to double your money. Being 16 and having \~60,000 in digital cash is a surreal feeling but also a feeling associated with the dreaded burning a hole in the wallet phenomenon. I was tempted to buy stuff but my stubborn overconfidence in luck told me to double that again and again. There were some nights where I would deposit $100 lose and then get mad and deposit $5000 and bet all in. I would think about how much I just won and it would fulfill my self-esteem. At the time of my gambling, I was very isolated and didn't go out with friends much and winning made me feel as if I had some worth. I will never forget these highs and lows of gambling and have not told my parents, nor do they have any clue. Hindsight is me thinking about the potential \~$60k I could have made but obviously that's no point in reminiscing on. I realized I wasn't gambling for the monetary gain but rather entertainment, reassurance to my ego and most important adrenaline.

I am now in college and have saved money from my past 4 years working and am in a comfortable position to avoid debt.

1764,addiction,2020/04/20,"i’m relapsing. i’m all kinds of fucked up. i think i took meth last night, thinking it was mdma. i took it before and i did feel like it was different but i was too busy because i took it when i was with friends. when ever im at college i smoke everyday and drink every weekend. i thought i would have stopped when i tried to kill myself on acid and told my parents that someone was trying to kill me while i was tripping. i swore off any substance (including weed and alcohol) for a whole month after that instance. and then i went back to smoking and drinking without touching anything hard. but then my body started rejecting alcohol from the first sip. I would vomit any alcohol I would intake. it was frustrating to go out to parties with friends being sober and them being fucked up. (also i know that i shouldnt be touching much substances including alcohol but i dislike drinking alone and i know drinking is bad but its hard for me to drink often because of the pain and the vomiting. i drink socially. but the substance itself is my least favorite due to the painful consequences ) i saw that my plug for weed was selling mdma in crystal form. ive only taken it a few months ago and last night. but i’m afraid that i’m going back to who i once was. before i didn’t care about my life and didn’t think about my friends or family. i started abusing substances since i was in ninth grade with dxm. and started buying weed in tenth grade. i didn’t get my hands on other substances until i got into college. 
i always don’t want to feel the way i do. and thats when i would take anything at all. 
later it wasnt just with being upset. it was being unsatisfied with life. 
the only things that i looked forward to was trying harder drugs. especially psychedelics. 
but when i had my near death experience and all my friends and family found out. 
i realized that there were people out there that were actually worried about me. i realized that im so selfish. 
my mentality was that atleast i was staying alive to do drugs instead of feeling suicidal all the time. 
but i want to get better without relying on drugs. 
my friends used to know but i stopped telling them because i feel ashamed. especially since i had said how drugs are ruining me. and that im trying to stop. 
but i feel disappointed cause i feel like i havent. 
i had things to look forward to when there were drugs involved. and i fooled myself into thinking that i was happy for once. but now it feels like a dream. 
being on “mdma” or meth last night made me hate myself the whole time. all i could do is write to myself how disappointed i was at myself and that i was ruining my life.
i havent been smoking weed for more than three weeks at first since corona. but then i started again..",541,1.0,1,0.0018484288354898336

I also felt shivers and I was irritable and restless. After some time and after I stepped outside to breathe some fresh air, I came back inside and my symptoms were mostly gone.

1773,addiction,2020/04/20,"i cant drink responsibly Hey so im a 21 y/o m and i cant moderate my drinking. On saturday night I drank an entire 1.75L and blacked out. My roommates are a couple (24m and 23f) and we knew each other before I moved in 4 months ago but werent super close. 
     Long story short I was being absolutely obnoxious and yelling and they took off to go for a walk. At some point I had locked myself out and the neighbor called them telling them I was standing in the street screaming. So they started walking back and when they got back two cruisers had pulled up and they were talking to me. They came over and told the cops lived right here with them and they would make sure i stayed in. 
      So we go back in and I proceed to start yelling again at the top of lungs at my roommate about why he called the cops. He in turn was furious at me for being so drunk I dont even know what im talking about. So we go out on the back porch and smoke some weed and talked and i guess I started crying and saying how much I hate myself and why I cant just be a functioning person. We went back in and we were all cool i guess. 
      So i wake up sunday get told all of this back from my roommates and one of my boys Id been talking to and he said to me that I sounded like OG Jim Lahey in the cut screaming the “im not drunk” and that “im having coronavirus withdrawls” and “everyone here is being assholes I wanna leave”. 
       So I obviously didnt drink sunday and I felt absolutely fine. I dont have a physical addiction to alcohol like i do to nicotine. My problem is I dont know when to stop. I cant pace myself at all and once im drunk and should stop is when I feel the best and my drunk brain think feel good= drink more feel better but being drunk is like a steep hill. theres a nice ascent but a steep drop if u go to far.

1777,addiction,2020/04/20,"Stealing My Sister's Pills Because I'm a Piece Of Shit. I Desperately Need Help TL;DR I'm factually depressed. I'm going to kill myself when I turn 21. I started stealing my sister's prescribed amphetamine pills for her ADHD and they honestly make me a much better person, and they make me genuinely happy. I need help, I don't know what is right.

&amp;#x200B;

A short story of me: Very depressed, on antidepressants, tried to commit suicide many times, you know, the usual. I'm not trying to get attention by saying this or sympathy rather an explanation for my shitty actions.

I started taking my sister's amphetamines (she has ADHD, gets it legally) and it fucks my depression up. It makes me super nice and generous to people, and just generally appreciate life. Antidepressants don't help, weed doesn't, not even mushrooms, the so-called cure for depression. 

This isn't the bad compared to other posts but I feel guilty afterward. I'm stealing from a little fucking girl who needs these to function in school for my own feelings. I can't stop. I am tired of laying around all these years hoping I get better. Just a small dose and I'm normal, productive, kind, just a good person. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to stop. I get addicted to drugs very easily. I thought about finding someone who sells Adderall for a stronger effect but I know if they get laced and I die it will hurt my mom. I'm tired of living my life for myself. Through these pills see everything wrong with me and I changed immediately. Too scared to tell my psychiatrist.

Today I just had the best conversation with my friend because these pills gave me energy and dropped my guard.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm ""high"" right now. I don't want to come down I want to keep taking more. 

&amp;#x200B;

In some ways, I need this off my chest, in other ways I'm reaching out as an 18-year-old dumb kid asking for advice from people with experience and who could share a possible solution. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know a lot of people say they have depression, but I can only admit this is a very serious fucking problem. I can only admit it when I take these pills. I truly believe I won't make it past 21 (My plan is to buy a gun so the failure rate is lower and I won't be kept in a hospital alive against my will). Now that I have taken these, I don't want to fucking die. I want to meet people, explore, live. Cheesy bullshit was sorry. I'm tired of being an introverted ""goth/emo"" who just smokes all day wishing I was dead while lying in bed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I just find street Adderall? This might be bad for the normal person but if it means keeping me alive longer, isn't this the healthiest habit I have? Or am I being a piece of shit stealing and being a junkie. If you read this far, please tell me how you genuinely feel. I don't want it sugarcoated I want to grow.

The author doesn't really provide a source for that but it made me curious about why some drugs might make relapse more likely when trying to quit. It's especially interesting to me given the danger of sudden benzo withdrawal compared to smoking. Maybe it's easier to measure gradually smaller doses when tapering off a benzo?

A month ago he drove home from college and was acting strange/off. He was slurring his words and his hands were shaking. Each day he got worse and it got to the point that he wouldn’t respond and would stare at you without really being “there”. My family and I researched and researched and figured out it probably benzo withdrawal. None of us have had experience with addiction. He told our dad a few months before that he had taken them “once or twice”. None of us knew how bad it was. We took him to the ER and he was checked in for 3 days. During that I time I had to witness my baby brother withdrawal horribly from these drugs. I had to feed him and help him put on clothes. 

My family and I stayed strong for him but it was one of the hardest things I’ve ever been through. He is now staying with our parents and staying home because of COVID.
