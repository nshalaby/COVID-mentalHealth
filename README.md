# COVID Mental Health Visualization

Project Part A
COMP 4304

Part A submission (due midnight Oct 23, 2020)

Using D3.js

The media has well informed us of the pitfalls of the US response to COVID-19 compared to the rest of the world.
The media has lacked a full picture of what lockdowns are doing to people's mental health.
I found this interesting data about how lockdowns and mental health rises are positively co related.

The media does not mention immune boosters and how to stengthen your immunity 
There is no care for the wellbeing of people. Its alot of numbers, data and fear.


Propose and implement (using d3.js) one visualization design which addresses the broad question:

How successful has the U.S.A. been in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to other countries?


Economy of USA:

the top billionaires gain since the start of covid 
as cases increase how the 1% gain billions 

Lock downs, strong arm police vs mental helth issues
