      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        
        
        The media has informed us of the pitfalls of the US response to COVID-19 compared to the rest of the world.
       
        I found this interesting data about how lockdowns and mental health rises are positively co related.
        The data was taken from reddit posts and sorted into categroies.

        The largest ones being addiction and suicidewatch. 
        These both have increased dramatically since covid-19.
        
      
      
        
        How successful has the U.S.A. been in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to other countries?

        This question is broad and I chose to look at the mental health data to show that the lock down measures and the government inititives 
        negively impact mental helath across the world.
        
        In my finial submission I will add a map that will hopefully show the regions in which mental health is the best and worst. 
        
        If I have time I will integrate the economy into my data.

        This Graph is zoomable and you can move up and down the y-axis. The data is linked to the  keys and you can add and remove the 3 categories.
