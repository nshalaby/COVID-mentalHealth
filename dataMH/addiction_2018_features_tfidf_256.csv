I'll still take them after I detox for a while because I do need them for my back but I'll only be sticking to x1 200MG. Going cold turkey for a week or two until my tolerance drops to feel more effects and feel like there helping me again.

The only thing is, the withdrawels are horrible, worse than herion according to many H addicts, wish my luck, as this will be panic, anxiety inducing hell with burning skin, cold sweats, so weak I can't walk, every bone on my body hurts, my hair hurts, breathing hurts

addiction,PurposedPorpoise,2018/01/02,"Quitting coke and nicotine I'm gonna start by saying I've been doing really well and am very proud of myself. I haven't done coke in over 10 weeks now, which is the longest time I can remember, probably the longest time in 9 or 10 years. I've tried to get it twice, which isn't great, but it didn't pan out and I didn't try very hard or care that much when I couldn't.

As for nicotine, I'd been vaping for 2 or 3 years. My vape broke recently and instead of buying another one I figured I'd quit. I gotta say, I really miss vaping, but it was pretty excessive. I would wake up and immediately reach for my vape. Any time I had even a second of inactivity I'd reach for it. It's nice to not be attached to it anymore. I've bought 3 packs of cigarettes since I broke the vape, a period of about a month. So not horrible, but I hate cigarettes. I hate smelling like them, I hate tasting them after having one, but God did that first one feel way better than it should have.

Unfortunately I have been undergoing an immensely stressful period because of my work, which is a bad time to try and quit addictive drugs, but the stress came about after I'd already decided to quit so I couldn't exactly plan around it.

I guess I just wanted to vent a bit. I just had a cigarette on my break and I smell awful. I can reliably get a few days without nicotine but I usually crack at that point. I'm happy with reduced consumption but I really wanna stop altogether.

Everything seemed to be going fine, but then in spring of 2017, she lost a sequence of jobs, and started to unravel in general because she was still using despite being on suboxone, and she just wasn't able to ""control"" her habit as well as she once could. Fast forward to August of 2017, drug-related legal trouble is looming, and she entered inpatient rehab, which she completed after about six weeks. I let her move in with me when she got out. She was unpacking her things and found some drugs, which I found her using (found her passed out on the floor of the bathroom)...relapse #1. I confronted her about it, tried to understand, and moved on. She started an intensive outpatient program shortly after as part of her recovery, had been going to meetings, etc., and all seemed good except for the single incident. Then, last week, I discovered some heroin she had purchased from the dark web, which I flushed. She refuses to discuss it. All she'll do is say she ""wasn't thinking straight,"" and her solution was for me to kick her out, putting the onus of dealing with this firmly on me. I also know that she's been purchasing bitcoin as recently as two days ago, which is a huge red flag that she may try again. 

One final detail to note is that she is very resistant to any kind of talk therapy, and my impression based on her recounting of events is she just went through the motions while in rehab. Also fairly sure she has an undiagnosed personality disorder...while not diagnostically 100% borderline personality, she's pretty damn close, and this just complicates things even further. 

What do I need to do / should I be doing. I'm about at my wit's end, and I'm about to kick her out, but I do have very strong feelings for her (we've been through a lot together and had an overall intensely rocky relationship aside from dealing with her addiction), and I don't want to be the guy who abandoned his girlfriend when she theoretically needs me the most (I realize that letting her stay in my house and my life in general is a kind of enabling behavior, but another complicating factor is that she's completely alienated her family over this despite THEIR best efforts to help her, so I'm all she's got). I know my thinking reeks of codependency, but I can't help feeling the way I do and really need some perspective on the whole mess, as any that I once had is long gone. Advice of all kinds is welcomed and appreciated. Throwaway email and account.

TL;DR: What is my move with a long-term gf who has emotional/personality issues, failed rehab, and continues to acquire opioids?",8.166136004217186,7.535311594095943,8.157071692145497,71.05761070110701,62.210332103321036,11.801897733263047,37.80732735898789,11.135684009426244,4.22634823405377,2292,100,413,55,28,744,269,542,0.071,0.8340000000000001,0.095,0.9264,1,0,5,0,0,0,82.0,0,1,1,9,21,22,2,0,21,1,45,11,0,3,5,75,78,36,0,6,9,0,2,0,3,3,10,1,0,3,24,29,0,3,13,0,3,12,5,8,2,6,21,5,73,14,79,47,14,75,0,3,1,1,67,30,1,8,33,301,97,4,0.07305602236701828,0.0,0.0,0.31856739141584706,0.0,0.07138949953842152,0.12951951176041296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11684574938498125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09936120081465176,0.07660560932375265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04453427315345021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07666778827578481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15319569900565522,0.0,0.08193854116428154,0.05832928923742031,0.0,0.0,0.04711509065279042,0.15063510236243713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2541653765810838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06470595164091987,0.0,0.08147677642659425,0.048252813765658986,0.0,0.0,0.06980816011874492,0.06565804222396021,0.0,0.06887071606813773,0.0,0.07387863999325674,0.0,0.0,0.08002930155290662,0.0,0.062141415304699424,0.0,0.24030647315225376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08303884217574521,0.06127592544195056,0.11685914976311434,0.0,0.0,0.07233694799482274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09793582367550638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0842968411222181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07625150680067573,0.07249682947008712,0.0,0.0,0.22822981539491585,0.08029935862574368,0.05955040888653591,0.0,0.07735577922977753,0.0,0.14940946513445408,0.051601629121084194,0.0,0.07322132691746823,0.0,0.12930456171171406,0.0,0.0,0.07974927841183793,0.06210961770835631,0.06593591248378146,0.0,0.0,0.07406734008403447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23294097036126685,0.0,0.16251034468693765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15560455906047185,0.04950465146061118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07911255296607253,0.0,0.0,0.19136910248620664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14864847772278508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07344148068762794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046801558634677866,0.0,0.07213400854322206,0.07843482756904017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05809708124028199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13301491794124554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15512828594597725,0.07786799943016405,0.05834263383261205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06885443649840363,0.0,0.0,0.058719663465666226,0.0,0.0,0.08354592847216744,0.0,0.09707035010222342,0.09362269851978487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06980816011874492,0.0,0.0992004873279009,0.0,0.14273023679468666,0.07605389574307428,0.0,0.12619389402061498,0.0,0.12055773899679552,0.043090334808338994,0.05798847007700283,0.1172022689429686,0.0,0.13137227556704853,0.06772366465119409,0.0,0.08156443999180843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14113704950573974
addiction,whattheheyyy,2018/01/02,"My brother has a problem I'm not against weed. I just think that too much of anything can't be good for you. He smokes three times a day, on his way to school, after school and in the afternoon. He's been catched doing it inside the school also. He does it in the bathroom of our house, on the roof, everywhere. 

My parents are aware and we all support him and care for him, no one judges.  But we all think he was a problem. He does it too much and I don't know how to help him. He has a very ""tough guy"" personality. He is agressive and gets mad easily. 

He's only 16. I just want him to have a good life, but weed is his priority, he just wants to smoke all day and he doesn't care about his future. And what scares me the most is that he might want to do other stuff, like more dangerous and addictive drugs. 

We are just looking to handle this the best way possible, but we are not sure how.

I’ve struggled with binge eating / non-purging bulimia and trichitillomania and cyclical alcohol abuse issues for a decade. It’s hard to focus on just one though it’s been easiest to just ignore the trich because, though I hate having ultra short hair all the time and counting the days til people notice my balding patches, trich doesn’t reduce my overall life quality like binge eating and booze. So.... I’m asking for any advice from those dealing with anything comparable.

addiction,Flyr0per,2018/01/03,"My New Years resolution: to kick the porn habit. For the last 4 years, the porn and sex industry has been a huge factor in my life. At my “peak” watching years, I would masturbate 3-4, sometimes 5-6 times a day, most of the time when I was just bored and had nothing to do. I would wake up in the middle of the night to masturbate. At one point, I had 30+ incognito tabs of different porn star profiles that I would rotate through. 

Then, a couple months ago, I started having problems. It would take me a while to get a solid erection, and when I did, my climax would be lackluster. I started to regret doing it every time I was done. I knew I had to stop, but I kept going. But now, with the new year coming in, I want to get this problem out of my life, and I just don’t know how. I had been eating correctly and working out almost every day for most of 2017, but there was also family issues in the last couple years as from about 2013 to now, my mom has been in and out of rehab for alcoholism. 

I’m just a teenager (15). The last thing I need is to have this problem hanging over especially with my role in the family increasing with my moms problems. If anyone has had any problems with this type of addiction and knows how to overcome it, I’m open to all suggestions. I’d rather not come out with the information to my dad, but if it would help my situation and help me come to terms with my addiction, I’ll do it.

addiction,Warpedpink,2018/01/04,"Can I “kidnap” a drug addict if it is for their own good? Someone I care SO MUCH about has fallen on hard times and developed a meth addiction this past year. He is a truly wonderful person and the funniest guy I (used to) know. He says he doesn’t want to quit, but I don’t believe him for one second. I think he doesn’t know how to quit and besides, he is the most stubborn person I have ever known.

addiction,SallyMcChestnut,2018/01/04,"My boyfriend just quit opiates - how can I help? My boyfriend has been addicted to poppy seed tea for about 2 years (we've been together 3 years). He's 23, I'm 25. I didn't realize how bad it was until recently, and I told him he has to get clean or I'm leaving him. I love him so much and want to do everything I can to help him get clean, but I'm struggling with the line between being supportive and enabling/coddling him.
He's going to meet with someone at a rehab (recommended by his primary care doctor) this week, and he's already been clean for a couple days and is having serious withdrawals.
My question is, what can I do?
He's been trying to get clean for over 6 months now - and I've caught him relapsing 3 times in the past month. He has a guy he works with who sells lortab, so he could easily get that without my knowing. I know it'd show up on a drug test, but I want to prevent that from even happening.
Is it too extreme to take control of his finances and give him an ""allowance"" to make sure he's not buying drugs?
I've never been one to even go through his phone or anything so that level of ""crazy girlfriend"" is weird to me, but I think it might be necessary.
We plan on spending our lives together, and in every other way he really is amazing, and I don't want to lose him over this fucking addiction.
Any advice on how I should be handling this would be really appreciated. I'm really stressed out and worried that I'm going to lose him.",4.050117056856188,4.697269889632112,5.2371555183946485,84.1423553511706,70.83946488294315,8.52180602006689,29.331270903010033,8.697196308434329,2.09474033444816,1143,43,240,19,20,380,165,299,0.054000000000000006,0.767,0.18,0.9881,0,0,2,0,0,0,36.0,2,0,0,6,12,13,1,2,7,0,31,9,0,6,2,44,59,22,0,6,8,0,0,0,1,3,6,0,4,1,14,15,1,2,5,1,4,4,5,8,0,1,9,0,30,5,38,41,1,28,0,2,0,2,35,11,1,4,12,149,44,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2512669633938404,0.0,0.11261556110625097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12717513703826985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07837019067426496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09483637834401278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09622431766986457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11749941656638685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12925647117720693,0.09201333079615724,0.12751581272453685,0.0,0.07432314842857618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11795759712657168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2672939921839679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15223576947056627,0.0,0.09709843540360244,0.0,0.10357429753670867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10654165436606937,0.24084191359816146,0.11055299564727901,0.1964882622591166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1141101428056149,0.10191030314488404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15449187635338718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12667069228077887,0.0,0.0,0.12202725245446215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017629773127128,0.0,0.0,0.2578581643514049,0.0,0.0,0.10401263252192128,0.0,0.07692657780120735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12225616944731167,0.0,0.0,0.1839740709738576,0.0,0.084717944754683,0.0,0.08888363892227155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07809263459825316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11001388563766823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.129100179973652,0.12257667827371775,0.0,0.0,0.22148567311869505,0.0,0.11379000972777613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09764626441814668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13201214962152125,0.1204785410297332,0.0,0.0,0.13077805746720694,0.10861654796654288,0.0,0.08664949817437717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07384400222901512,0.0,0.0,0.06719997651934978,0.0,0.0,0.11012102861621062,0.0,0.07824342945864632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20392252070988293,0.09147569513216833,0.09244216141923367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11109155539920344,0.0,0.08389934582966492,0.1170363521496705,0.0,0.08186636409872737,0.0,0.0,0.14842731891698255

After the first week hell, i felt on the upswing, but i still have had good days and bad days for the past month. Is it possible for me to have protracted withdrawal syndrome? Recently after a couple weeks of relative normalcy i’ve had much more muscle pain, fatigue, and trouble sleeping than usual. I’v also had some stomach trouble but i also have GERD.

addiction,Geilerjunge,2018/01/04,"Friend needs help Hi I came here because I have no idea what I could say to my friend about this matter.

I've been aware he constantly uses prescription drugs, smokes weed, vapes strange ""CBD juice"", and who knows what else. However I smoke weed myself so I understand why he might use some of those lighter forms of drugs. The difference being is I smoke maybe like twice a week versus he takes drugs daily and in heavy amounts.

Now he just told me he cried for 10 minutes straight because drugs fucked him up, yelled at his parents, ""fucked shit up"" (guessing means trashed objects in his room). He also said he wants to buy the worst drugs till he dies. Like cocaine and heroine. I assume he's above meth. 

I have no idea if I should call the cops, or what to even say. Any advice would be helpful.

addiction,totallyabsurd3,2018/01/05,"Sugar and the blues . I found this link at r/nootropics , https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29191750   ,  it's about depression and anxiety brought on by sucrose withdrawal.

I'm 2 years off booze and am in the process of attacking my 35 year long relationship with nicotine ( almost two weeks ).

Now , about a month ago I stopped sugar and caffeine ( I was a two sugars in coffee guy - several times a day .)

My thrust is that I had intuited ( remembered reading ... ) about the effects on mood that sugar buzzes and downers had .

so , before the attack on the cigarette addiction I binned the sugar .

I think I did notice a bit more calmness ...

I have back slid for sure , but just today I cooked some healthy food and didn't go and buy a stack of 'cheer up ' confection .

Most of you are probably well onto this , or may disagree , but I just wanted to say that I think sugar is a really underestimated mood swinging fuel.

It seems to me that people can 'forget' about a seemingly innocent 'food' , and be banged around by it while they are battling the big bad drugs .

Addiction is a demon .
Good luck folks !

addiction,RickettsLaw,2018/01/05,"Tweet to help save a free rehab center doing amazing work from being shut down. Hey redditors,

Could really use your social media influence.  I'm an attorney defending a loose network of unlicensed rehab centers that treat homeless, uninsured, and anyone else who wants to come for alcohol and drug addiction.  The 90-day program with food and shelter is completely free - no insurance, no government grants, nothing.  It's all paid for by graduates who want to help the next person turn their life around.

The State of California shut them down 6 months ago and is now suing them because they're not licensed.  But they can't get licensed because the law was designed to force a very lucrative business to spend lots of money on fees and other expenses, to make sure people weren't just lining their pockets.  Obviously, these donors aren't making money off their rehab centers, and can't afford the same types of expenditures as for-profit places.

Help us by tweeting #SaveCorriente at @DHCSDirector, who runs the Department of Health Care Services (the ones bringing the lawsuit and also the ones who decide if my clients can get a license).

You can also watch this cool video that tells a little more about the problem:

addiction,jamesarkerze,2018/01/06,"Any workaholics here? I have strong workaholic tendencies. So I've been looking into workaholism, and it seems that actual workaholics must be indeed too busy drinking workahol to be visible and talking on the internet.

So, anyone here? if any of them are here, I'd love to hear about how it started for you, how you're dealing with it, if work is the only addiction you have, and so on.

I've been also wondering if there are actual personality traits or commorbid conditions that workaholics particularly share among themselves more than people with other primary addictions. Apparently workaholics are more likely to have ADHD, OCD, anxiety, depression according to a research. It's funny because I do have ADHD and mild OCD tendencies.",8.759468503937008,10.114253952755906,8.626446850393702,61.4903789370079,60.65354330708661,12.019291338582676,40.28444881889764,11.698219412168324,5.550638582677166,600,31,83,18,8,194,84,127,0.041,0.858,0.101,0.8340000000000001,1,0,1,0,0,0,17.0,0,2,1,2,12,5,0,0,3,0,14,4,0,2,1,16,20,14,0,4,4,0,0,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,7,7,1,0,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,2,5,4,14,15,2,5,0,1,1,1,9,4,0,6,2,64,12,2,0.0,0.0,0.3589036881598937,0.4009383527879755,0.4420043519525415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14705818470772886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.250105423587808,0.0,0.1406767032769206,0.0,0.0,0.12858140362127107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1120987182109052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1895843436606025,0.15838571492494766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18014392955126568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2072593934096311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08984023172533055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1544227752853115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16596950506029967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13985798011144446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1274874015055584,0.16056720345068393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16740816396356942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13015954366112434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1478052417201502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19942278389749968,0.13387540113743096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,signeduptosayshills,2018/01/06,"I want to quit but I LOVE it too much or does it LOVE me too much? Basically I have addiction issues, I quit one but start another. I didn't have depression until I started, well I had anxiety issues which I don't have anymore because being high 24/7 means I don't care for anxiety (apart from when i quit benzos and the rebound anxiety).

Anyway my point is how do I control an addiction problem? If I quit all the drugs is it possible to become addicted to something that increases my pleasure levels so much as drugs but are natural highs? My pleasure levels from doing this I used to enjoy are dropping.

I'm a poly drug addict and im currently high and I feel amazing but i want to quit. 

Any guidance from ex addicts will be appreciated.

tl;dr I can admit I have addiction problems and I can do the first step of admitting but the rest is harder...

addiction,goingtoriseup,2018/01/06,"Tackling everything at once I am tackling some life-long addictions. I'm going to be replacing a lot of bad habits with positive ones. I'm 35 years old. I am going to quit smoking cigarettes, drinking, gambling, junk food. And replacing it with mindfulness and healthy eating. I'm also planning on adapting a more positive outlook and personality.

I know it's going to be hard and I know it's a lot to do all at once, but I want to rewire my brain. I'm tired of being who I am and reliant on substances. I want to be somebody better. 

Has anyone ever done this - what tips do you have?

addiction,paige_lynn39,2018/01/07,"Brother is a veteran, addict; just relapsed Hi all, I'm new to this sub, so please be nice. My brother is an alcoholic and a veteran. He was recently discharged due to his drinking and went through and extensive rehabilitation, to which he responded very well. He stayed sober for four months, but after the reality of being kicked out of the military set in, and he realized he was living in Texas with no one around who really truly cared for him, he took a downturn which is more intense than anything I've ever seen him go through. 

His main vice used to be drinking, but since he has access to so much more, he has been on a four-day alcohol and Vicodin bender and has barely eaten or slept. He confided in me that he considered suicide and almost went through with it a couple of times over the last few days and I have no idea what to do. He is in Del Rio, TX and I'm in Chicago. I wish I was closer. He's planning to move back to this region (where we're from) within the next week, but I just wish I could keep an eye on him for the next couple of days while he tries to get clean again. He doesn't have health insurance and can't afford to go to the ER for help. I'm trying to find him some veterans resources in his area but it's hard, the area is so small...

If anyone has any input or words of wisdom, I'd like to hear them from an addict. I have addictive tendencies but I've never experienced something as intense as he has.

addiction,RoseBelvedere,2018/01/07,"I’m pregnant, my boyfriend has a drug problem, he’s been a complete d*ck to me.. what am I to do? I’ve been with a guy who has a pretty big drug problem. He loves pills and almost anything to get him high. I noticed recently how big of a problem this is for him. I’m actually pregnant with his baby. He’s been really distant and I have a feeling drugs are playing a big part in his horrid actions towards me. I’ve been reading about addicts recently and realized I might be an “enabler” which only makes things worse.,. I probably am an enabler because the whole year this has been going on and I pretty much never really left. What can I do? If there’s anything I can do? I stopped talking to him past two days because he’s been so mean to me that I couldn’t take the stress. I need to be healthy at this time for the baby. He only texts to ask about doctor appointments and only cares about the baby since he supposedly is very serious about being there for the baby. It drives me crazy because I miss him so much and I thought we loved each other but this whole pregnancy he’s been acting like he completely hates me and he isn’t interested in me at all.

addiction,MiracleSoda,2018/01/07,"Trying to stop using Zopiclone to sleep.. But im loosing the battle. Help! I always had sleeping troubles, but alot of shit happend in my life the past year. So for the past 3 months i've barley slept, I tried CBT with a shrink, mindfullness exercises 20 mins a day, tons of diffrent medications. Im daily on 2mg melatonin and 15mg mirtazapin. Still cant fall back asleep after I wake up.  

So to survive the holidays I've taken 7.5 - 10mg Zopiclone to fall asleep and then another 7-10mg when i wake up 4 hours later so i can go back to sleep. This usually made me sleep decent each night, 1-3 times I've also taken a 7.5mg to take a nap during the day during this period.  

Now after new years I wanted to quit. I dont wanna become addicted to them. I dident sleep for 3 days straight, I took a huge dose of Theralen to sleep on the fourth night.. got afew hours of sleep. Now last night I yet again dident sleep at all.. 7 in the morning i took 3.5mg zopiclone and still dident sleep.  

Now I dont know what to do. Tommorow im supposed to go back to work and on tuesday my long distance GF is supposed to come visit me. 

Questions:
-  Did i fuck up my cold turkey by taking that 3.5mg last night? Are my other 3-4 days clean wasted?
- What should i DO? Should I hop back on the pills? I only have 5-6 of them left anyway so they will soon run out.
- Should I stick it out? I dont know how much longer I can go without sleep...

addiction,AmbitiousBadger,2018/01/07,"18, addicted to pills Instead of killing myself one night, I decided to buy some Xanax, the moment I swallowed those 2 bars, I felt a click. I've been taking Oxy, Hydrocodone, Xanax, Ativan, anything I can get my hands on. If I go without taking them, I get this rush of anxiety.

I don't know where to start. I just don't know what to do. I know it's killing me, but I just don't know what to do.

I'm scared of going to someone, everyone knows I'm battling depression, and that I'm bipolar. I don't want people to think I'm even more fucked up.

I feel like, maybe it would be easier to take everything I have and just go to sleep.

addiction,trunic,2018/01/07,"Binge drinking I binge drink almost every night and regrettably wake up at like 1pm with nauseous and anxiety. I know that this is unhealthy and that it needs to stop. But I've been sober for months at a time and feel great between those breaks. Will even control myself after 2 drinks, but when i get in this funk... it seems like boredom and the loss of my mom at the age of 24 is a major factor for me drinking. A pint of run and 4 beers a night. I know i really don't need it but its starting to affect my physical and mental health.

addiction,Jimmy1shoe2,2018/01/08,"Feeling like wife’s family wants me to relapse When I was newly recovered, I started seeing my wife. I told her flat out in the middle of our first date I am an addict. 

She kept coming back, helped me stay clean, an we got married two years later.  We have a beautiful seven year old daughter and five year old son. 

My mother in law never liked me and was always talking about my addiction, saying things in front of family members I didn’t know. Now, she says stuff to nieces and nephews in of the kids!!! My nephew told me... now I feel sick because I’d never do anything to jeopardize my family. I love my wife and babies.  I’d never want to hurt them.

What does a guy do? I realize my babies aren’t old enough to get what’s going on, but I worry about the future. I’m not like some crazy Charlie Sheen character waiting to break out...

addiction,Stankyprawnpenis,2018/01/08,"On my own Im a 23 year old male, this is my first post on Reddit as I need proper insight and thoughts on !y situation, even help. 

Last august I was put on tramadol for a back injury, starting at 50MG SR 2x a day. When I used to get my box of 60, I always traded them for a good bag of green as I had never took a pill in my life, not even so much as paracetamol. I don't drink or smoke cigarettes.

Then, I started to try them out, they where great for my back pain, 100mg also gave me a great feeling of well being, warmth, comfort and I was living life and so calm, they completely took my depression away. 

Now, in 2018 I am addicted to them, just at around Christmas time as I started smoking green again, I noticed I stopped getting that 'feeling' from them and they are not helping my back as much, I even took as much as 800MG at once and felt nothing apart from a nod. 

I don't know what to do as my family think I'm clean so I can't tell them, I am stuck in this endless cycle of now having to take X2 200MG SR pills to feel normal. 

As they are the only thing that help my back with the next step being oxynorm (UK oxycodone) which in fairness people have told me the WDs are no where near as bad as tramadol, H addicts have also told me tramadol wds are hell.

I have been able to lower my dose before down to 50MG a day or 50MG anytime I felt the WDs were kicking in. I can't even work because I'm afraid what if one day I run out of trams and can't go to work because the WDs completley incapacitate me (this has happened before where I lost my job) 

I just constantly feel this shear feeling of panic, like something bass going to happen, sweating, burning skin, unable to sit still or calm down it's just full blown panic mode it's insane, and I'm stuck between a rock and a hard solace because I don't know what to do, I honestly just want to disappear (not kill myself) but just go to sleep and vanish from the earth to escape my problems + WD. 

I didn't take none on Saturday + Sunday but had to take 2 today as the feeling of panic and pain started coming, this is the problem I have to fucking take atleast 400 to feel normal.",5.820814123139769,4.565112384787472,6.429386246474081,83.58252115552965,67.2102908277405,8.937224005446941,31.067892228382448,7.423996415210882,1.7905582919949419,1664,52,363,13,23,547,224,447,0.114,0.797,0.08900000000000001,-0.9006,2,0,4,0,0,1,44.0,0,0,9,4,28,23,3,4,18,0,31,14,3,1,1,52,76,35,1,7,14,0,11,1,0,0,9,0,1,1,14,15,1,1,14,2,1,11,13,14,1,2,19,13,52,9,65,55,6,68,1,2,2,1,17,25,2,4,31,237,66,4,0.07623978522392845,0.0,0.0,0.16622523861808355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12193785739779968,0.0634376087481646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06786957262240698,0.0,0.0,0.07162978787814278,0.23449475534444075,0.06365703612402399,0.13942519632121256,0.0,0.12974888380009958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06567382423848075,0.07993596428467473,0.08238812314716408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14750506292810367,0.0,0.06566521529811792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07468596473007814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2014226364234621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07187208434199455,0.0,0.2698438831091672,0.0,0.14640429961971105,0.0,0.0,0.0648495223643612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07048245292798967,0.07966428219682073,0.0,0.12998648066789548,0.06394631467372118,0.0,0.16810926471893353,0.0,0.0,0.13483718057552527,0.0,0.068295872540694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.153305762909698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0823520508546719,0.0,0.07565622284290256,0.0,0.0843480264863444,0.0,0.08379878423287566,0.06214560054608567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10770082996394696,0.037246908040110216,0.0,0.06732112713034434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08322473166328162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16813504320511896,0.05653083471273208,0.0588008223983669,0.0,0.0810818765071536,0.0,0.14939760456067513,0.0731541301207375,0.08679950079133666,0.08000082968022366,0.08119288306606617,0.05166205156888387,0.05798379215909539,0.1622490135655808,0.2683528835426825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052855067590072725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07301663962136701,0.0,0.0,0.14590235610280286,0.0,0.0766420417200243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08569671291347711,0.07629484468503345,0.0,0.0,0.05869311140428311,0.0,0.0,0.21585164954207034,0.0,0.06088519096277464,0.06373987423880494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2292913213202166,0.0,0.06663693269027278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05065032562425766,0.04885137594389075,0.0,0.0605258734011504,0.04445603186818454,0.0,0.07226640190818369,0.14570076393136486,0.2541156198278501,0.0517618096561098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06584669589845032,0.0,0.0,0.04496820062979588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06854872294643455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11100694330895906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04909592206466453

addiction,DomnuDoctor,2018/01/08,"Addicted to feeling addicted Sorry for all the mistakes in my text if there are any,i'm not a native english speaker.
First of all,i'm 22 ,a uni student at medicine and a royal class fuck up and perfectionist who's also lazy and sometimes dissasociates with everything around him and numbs himself in addictions.
Which addiction may you ask?
1.Gambling degenerate (since 12 years old)
Oh,there's been some really tough times ,like having money for the week (45$) and in 2-3 hours ,left with only close to 9$ for all my living expenses,full of excuses and bullshit i always got through,full of debts and crying myself at night .I have lots of stories and i will post them as time goes by,for therapy.
2.Smoking (since 17 years old)
The ideea of smoking never appealed to me until i saw one of my relatives,who's the nicest,smartest girl i know take a drag out of a cigarette.I thought *pff,if SHE does that ,then there's nothing wrong with me trying this stuff out*.Fast forward to me battling this addiction over the years,hating myself for it and searching for that dopamine spike again and again.
3.PMO
This is something that always dragged me behind.Staying and losing all my energy to feel lethargic,going on on days on end,week after week,month afther month not accomplishing what i wanted to do.Also my mind dwelved into some pretty dark corners with some fetishes but i'm keeping them at bay trying to become sentisized again.
4.Food
Back in HS i used to go to the gym ,take care of my self,and feel like a million bucks.Now i'm close to 200 pounds at 6 feet 1,it's not that bad but i don't feel good ,i am overweight and not pleased with myself.
5.Internet and games 
Anything that can numb me and make me not to think ,i craved it.Didn't have a great childhood ,dad missed alot of it and when he was part of it,it wasn't nice.I guess i keep trying to fill that void by doing all this stupid shit.
I'm not looking for sympathy by writing this ,i'm not that misfortunate and i know it but what cuts deeper than losing a friend ,a loved one telling you they don't love you anymore or the absence of a parent ,is the fact that you know you can be great and have all the right tools at hand,but you don't care.That's WASTED POTENTIAL.
So,i will keep a tiny journal here,trying to undestand better what addiction is and how i can stop being a slave to dopamine.All these quick fixes that we all crave.All this need to numb ourselves because of the harsh truth of our reality.All the hiding from problems.
I wish you can all learn something from me and i can learn something from you.

addiction,RedBeardMoto,2018/01/08,"Can Ativan cause a positive for methamphetamines on a urine drug test? Hey guys, I’m pretty bummed. My brother is a recovering meth addict and he has some mental health issues. New Year’s Eve he had a bad episode and we took him to the behavioral hospital. Before then he took an Ativan to try and calm down. The hospital gave him a urine test and it came back positive for meth. Could the Ativan cause this? I wanna believe him when he says he hasn’t done anything but being a recovering addict, I feel like it’s an obvious relapse. Any help would be appreciated.

addiction,voluntold123,2018/01/08,"Morning fix. Woke up, my heart instantly sank about 2 feet when I realized it was Monday morning. Then I had to dive for the bathroom when I realized I was about to crap my guts out. With that out of the way, I have a moment to reflect on my immediate situation. 

I’ve been drunk and high on my drugs of choice for about 3 days and I’m feeling utterly terrible this morning. There’s a couple of big meetings today at work that I’ve no idea how I am going to get through. I’ve called in sick a couple of days last week, so that’s out of the question for the foreseeable future.

I hate doing this, but I may need to do a few lines of drugs before the commute in to the office just to straighten myself out. Doing drugs in the morning is one of the many red lines I promised myself I would never cross, yet here I am again.

This is really not what I thought I would be doing as a supposed ‘professional’ in my 30’s. Oh well, at least it’s only -8 this morning.

addiction,wormsaremyjam,2018/01/08,Vyvanse abuse I think I might be addicted/abusing my vyvanse prescription. At first I started using it for my add and adhd but now I think it might be fueling my eating disorder. I upped the prescription yesterday because I think I can do better in school but I know in the back of my mind I did it so I can eat even less than I do now. I used to be a fit swimmer and now I can’t even do a lap without getting tired. Nobody even notices I went from 155 pounds to 135. My goal was 135 and even though I’m there I’m still not satisfied. I don’t know what to do. The rational part of me know I need to stop but I can’t. ,-0.4994722222222201,1.5551378444444452,2.1228472222222234,94.8709375,89.07407407407408,5.74537037037037,21.030092592592595,7.1686216300943375,0.5785648148148144,479,17,113,8,16,165,75,135,0.095,0.823,0.08199999999999999,-0.1874,0,0,0,0,1,0,9.0,0,0,0,3,12,1,0,0,5,0,16,3,0,2,0,22,30,8,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,4,4,2,1,6,0,0,1,5,0,0,1,3,0,23,1,14,22,2,15,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,2,9,84,27,2,0.0,0.3450776286089237,0.0,0.0,0.17500990991821894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11197469050769017,0.0,0.0887701059474852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12879124061923378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1668959664853718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2980162825101262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3847290715160104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12386639838754125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07608173010439802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24009090307237224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3089648557769614,0.14703718215897488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10797721615226108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1657921470022737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15769494394521655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1473777138108777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10307233361166404,0.0,0.11629429245944853,0.1217469052628598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2799269959359458,0.14307333717464388,0.0,0.0,0.16737160705972565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25154211686663264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13499348839765898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14037486429977442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I feel like some of us are targeted by the industry and THEY win! Cause I'm always going for the 2 dollar 40oz, $6 vodka, $9 whiskey, and $15 case of beer. They make it so readily available and cheap its like a no brainer for me.

addiction,Pandachoko,2018/01/09,"Addicted to video games, can someone give some tips on how to stop? To make this post short as possible, I have been playing video games since I was 5 years old (I'm 21) but I am addicted to playing video games. Every time I get home from school, I sit in front of my PS4 to play that I forget to make homework and to read up for the upcoming exam. I gained quite a weight and every time I told myself this is the day where I will quit, it never happened.  

I want to focus on my future in terms of dream job etc, but every day when I get the opportunity to start work on the path, I sit down and play instead. (To animate.) I can't get my mind off video games and is almost obsessed with it. 

I can't seem to stop, does any of you have tips on how to stop?

addiction,mwyman47,2018/01/09,"Oxy addict at 19 years old I’m so scared that I’ll never get off these stupid pills. I’ve been doing oxy since this exact day last year. My boyfriend passed away due to excessive drinking and his heart couldn’t take it. Ever since he passed, my drug use has gotten out of control. I just need it. I need the escape. Even if it’s just for a few hours. I need to forget what it looked and felt like to find him dead in our bed. In my safe place.. he was my best friend. My biggest supporter and role model. He had his addictions but he was such an amazing person. His demons ended up destroying his life and I tried so hard to help him. And now I’m slowly killing myself. I’m too much of a coward to kill myself so this is the closest thing.. I know it’s wrong but I just feel this way. Please if anyone has advice I’d appreciate it. I don’t want my family to find me dead in my bed like how I found my boyfriend.

addiction,SnortingSmarties94,2018/01/10,"Do you think I need to go to rehab? (Long post) So I use meth. I guess you could call it an addiction, but not a life long addiction (more like almost 2 years). I use meth to make the pain go away...like all the painful thoughts, memories, self-hatred/severe self-criticism, codependency (well I guess I'm codependent while in either high or not), suicidal ideation, anxiety, and painfully shy personality. I also I guess like the way I look now that I am skinny. I was 140lbs in high school, then dropped to 120 lbs after mom died, now I am 106 lbs (5'6). My self esteem is and has always been pretty terrible. I find myself basing my self worth from being wanted physically by men...which isn't good, I know that...
I flunked my last semester of college because I couldn't leave the apartment most days (It's too hard, feel mostly like what's the point?) So to counteract these thoughts I smoke more but now went back to snorting. The school and my family aren't aware that I use cause I don't go full tweaker so  I am able to hide it but the school was understanding of this semester bc of the depression and stuff since my GPA proves I'm not a lazy student or a bad student...just struggling...
Though I am moving back home which is in a different state (Nv to Ca) and I am sad, scared, sick with fear and self hatred. I broke up with my ex so I'm moving back single (1st time in single in almost 3 years... and lonliness is scary bc I havent been single-single since mom died 4+years ago...I guess I'm a relationship hopper but my recent ex, I love him still...it hurts a lot moving without him but my issues were dragging him down too and I couldnt do that to him anymore). I'm afraid of moving back bc I want to get sober but I don't know if I trust myself to not look for someone who sells to buy from and fall into the lifestyle again...I'm really scared of that since I fall for broken people...because I feel more understood from them.
I've asked some people in my life what their opinions were. One said I need rehab but doesn't factor in money, my therapist didn't really give me an answer saying its up for me to decide but rehabs accept people who they think need a spot the most, my ex said I didn't and to just shut myself up in my room for a few days bc he said if I did go to rehab I'd be universally hated since I don't have a life long addiction. Then the same people also had the same varying opinions on if I should tell my dad about my use too so I'm left even more confused. I'm very much a person that doesn't want to make the wrong choice and I know I fuck things up for myself sometimes too bc I'm afraid of making the wrong choice or I don't feel worthy of the choices I have. So yeah...idk...I'm just confused and scared. I want to get better all around but don't know how to do it.",2.215832864180157,3.830123608620692,3.552533427163972,90.67519704433501,76.70689655172413,6.5277973258268815,20.802251935256862,7.290443533043144,0.4337744546094302,2183,52,479,26,49,714,258,580,0.223,0.716,0.061,-0.9988,1,1,4,0,0,0,89.0,0,2,3,1,27,32,2,9,27,0,40,17,1,9,3,96,96,40,3,14,23,6,4,3,0,1,14,4,2,5,20,16,1,0,18,0,4,11,19,23,1,1,17,11,69,9,55,73,19,60,0,5,2,2,33,24,1,21,24,290,89,6,0.0591666643927033,0.0,0.0,0.1935011925471634,0.0,0.0,0.0524476780718818,0.0,0.11849373556465632,0.0,0.0,0.09463112027703552,0.04923140451739157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045262336314135995,0.0,0.058677432520573815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052670875370800826,0.05531284429458127,0.0,0.055589028844436485,0.1819820511110129,0.04940169337468454,0.0721348988973353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05232810652736413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06041577957460476,0.0,0.0,0.06078046253910738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047239767082274335,0.0,0.0,0.07631520759454723,0.0,0.05096016134367273,0.0,0.12281131285602645,0.06181657130779007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03907902381727879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05577706549115775,0.06657894675363897,0.08974932982890732,0.04226867686420578,0.0,0.0,0.05407725936042836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0546986278321259,0.061824280262341824,0.05675805581035717,0.13450311548275712,0.04962619094922085,0.0,0.0,0.2607150053491517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05300170977860827,0.05841483177543068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250256588123623,0.05934898854082301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06333913794644838,0.0,0.0,0.06175462564398096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1300658056331191,0.048228728349554835,0.0,0.06264895459995047,0.0642847539819957,0.0,0.1253734944801325,0.08671753079585323,0.0,0.0,0.15708190836358346,0.09937019316932942,0.0,0.0,0.05030138224673515,0.053400224635221635,0.0,0.11848262375642392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13859056449212773,0.0,0.251539202749293,0.04349430613229521,0.13161399584732153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04009286303780566,0.0,0.1888725074215372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12305614593628085,0.10332409836615047,0.0,0.0,0.0559316222071205,0.0,0.05666530931155445,0.060193768487188035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07580736051798898,0.0,0.0584199431682172,0.06352285505174239,0.0,0.0,0.1688431406018254,0.0470517063010979,0.17770845829545834,0.17963946936861658,0.0,0.0,0.30861867365810275,0.06684148964230059,0.0,0.19577310478833446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0501317227368544,0.0,0.058517343972074684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047250574612708984,0.0,0.0,0.061853844083367526,0.06773167522921128,0.06471872770739573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051714272555519816,0.0,0.0,0.0686970576301882,0.039307702779978734,0.07582321899529165,0.058130947360267714,0.0939434450945214,0.03450055781309642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061594584257294825,0.0,0.2044040048722087,0.0,0.04881869455834738,0.13959212645692634,0.04696374421338998,0.0,0.0,0.05319793691977963,0.05484809065748108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05703455310722344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1293789187496795,0.0,0.11430417604082978

addiction,here4thenews,2018/01/10,"Looking for Some Real Valentine's Day Stories or Perspective Hi Addiction,

My name is Ryan and I work as a blogger for a number of addiction recovery centers in South Florida. I am writing a few posts about Valentine's Day after recovery and stories of joining the dating scene after recovery. 

I want to use real stories because at the end of the day, advice from a non recovering addict is not nearly as meaningful or accurate as a story from someone who has been there. 

If anyone is willing to share and help I would love to write a piece and feature a few stories. 

I will keep everything anonymous if that is preferred or use a first name and initial. I can also link to your reddit username if you like, you just let me know. Please feel free to answer here or PM me. 

Also feel free to pick and choose which questions you answer. 

1 - What was your first Valentine's Day like after recovery?
2 - Did you end any relationships after recovery or did your SO get into recovery too? 
3 - What is your biggest challenge in the dating scene now that you're in recovery?

addiction,skillsforilz,2018/01/11,"Anyone With Dual Diagnosis Really Struggling? Like Bad? I've been to several inpatient places and the last place figured out I need to focus on my mental health (really severe, lifelong depression and Depersonalization Disorder) as opposed to substance abuse because my mental health is what is causing or at least driving my addiction. I feel like I could do without drugs to some degree, the issue is that I just feel like plain shit .. day in and day out. It never gets better and I've had serious suicidal depression since I was 7 years old and am now 21 (3 weeks I'll be 22) and once I found drugs, it was a game changer in my life. After experimenting with so many different substances I can't count on 4 hands the different ones I've done, my favorite .. are dissociatives. Why? Ever heard about Ketamine being studied for depression. That's why. Well, DXM is very similar to Ketamine except it has much more potent action on serotonin and has a much longer half life and is fucking over the counter. Second favorite being Nitrous Oxide and Air Duster but I can easily do without those. Those are just wonky drugs when I'm looking to get weird. But the DXM or Ketamine? It is so fucking hard to stay away and that drug has given me this feeling I've never had before that feels more than just a drug. It feels like a state of being that is attainable without drugs, but all the shit I got going on in my mind, I don't feel like I can attain it without DXM. It completely rids me of depression, anxiety, Depersonalization, etc for DAYS after doing it. It literally fixed my issues and no other drug on the planet has given me this feeling of being truly alive. Not coke. Not heroin. Not adderall. Not shrooms. Not LSD. Not molly. Those are all fun, but DXM wasn't just a hallucinogen. It was legit medicine. It literally fixed my depression as long as I kept doing it. It didn't have to be everyday. Every other day or every 3 days. Kept the dosages below full blown trips. Just to get that magical, ALIVE feeling. When I got back into it again a few months ago, I was like ""holy shit, I'm back."" I felt in the moment. Happy. Content. Present. Alive. Welp, been bouncing around rehabs for several months and now I'm finally out but god damn is it hard... I'm back on SSRI's but I just feel like they can't suffice. I've been on max dosages before of other meds and while they kinda helped, it didn't compare to DXM. I feel unable to feel fully connected to myself and benefit from therapy either without DXM. It makes me so in tune with my thoughts and feelings and feel safe to articulate it to others. The way it makes me feel, I'm perfectly fine taking it forever even if it fucking kills me down the road. I've been without it for several months now and I'm almost debating using it again even though it's dangerous to combine it with SSRI's. I just feel like I'm time traveling until the next time I do DXM where I get that ""woah I'm back"" feeling.

addiction,Firerose157,2018/01/11,"Alcohol, Rehab in Hawaii? Someone very close to me is an alcoholic - it is destroying their relationship and affecting our family, as it has gotten progressively worse over the years. We have tried AA, counseling, they have begged to be taken in to limit their ability to access the problem, yet we have not found a permanent solution. We are not in the position to spend an extreme amount for rehab, but we need to help them. If you can recommend an affordable rehab in Hawaii, it would be much appreciated. Oahu is preferred, but I am willing to do anything to convince them to get help that we can afford, in their area or not.

addiction,Mayogir1,2018/01/12,"Any tips on helping my sometimes boyfriend beat his heroin addiction? I have been on and off with a man for the last four years. He has been a heroin user since we were introduced. He’s really good at hiding it too.

A few days ago, he overdosed on heroin. I got a call today asking if I wanted to see him. I did, because I’m so in love with him. when I got there his mom was there. We have met a few times and I know this is really hard on her. He’s her baby.

He got her to leave, and I could tell she was nervous to go, but I promised to stay until she got back. He was saying he thought he was going to die without getting a chance to say he has feelings for me. He’s also going to rehab. He’s going to check in Monday. 

His mom came back, and I left. She stopped me on the way out and thanked me for coming and told me I mean the world to him. I was happy to hear that because he’s so important to me. 

Aside from his addiction, he’s smart, motivated, sweet person, and if you didn’t know he was addicted, you’d never be able to tell. We haven’t been seeing each other as much because he’s been using and I am very anti-drugs and don’t drink much. He’s had a really rough year, and I wonder if the overdose was intentional. He’s very good at hiding things, isolating himself, and pretending he’s okay...

I know the prospects of him being able to get through rehab the first time are slim. I know that heroin is evil, I know he needs to really want to be clean for this to work.  However, I want to help. Even if we can’t be together. I want to help his mom at least, if she’ll let me. What can I do? What should I be aware of? What does this recovery look like? 

I’ve had so many people tell me he won’t get better, but I know it’s possible. I just want to help him and keep him alive.

addiction,jqthrowaway,2018/01/12,"Would my personal drug addiction data be of value to anyone? I don't want anyone to misunderstand what I am saying, so let me first clarify by saying I am NOT trying to find someone to buy my data. I am wondering if in any way this would be valuable information for anyone doing research. I have been clean from my addiction for over 2 years now, but I recently remembered the data that I have. 

I was addicted to adderall for a few years and during the last year of it I became very obsessive with keeping lists of things. For an entire year I have a record of every pill I took broken down by date and time. Along with that I also have Fitbit data. So I have my sleep logs, 24/7 heart rate tracking, steps taken, etc. I was also in grad school at the time so I have my academic records as well.

addiction,iLikePsychedelics,2018/01/12,"Do i have a drug problem? So its currently 2am on a friday morning and im pretty buzzed off of a little over 7 beers, i have about 500mgs of mdma and im really tempted to take some, probably will. I did about 300mgs last night and had a fuckin awesome time, (first time doing m in about 8 months tho) im temporarily laid off my job for a few more weeks and have nothing but free time and a decent amount of money that i find myself mostly spending on drugs (weed, booze, lsd, shrooms, mdma... All of which ive done several times in the last month) i always have a good time when i do these substances but i feel like i might have a problem with self control.  I go to the gym atleast 3 times a week but always find myself staying up super late getting as fucked up as i can. Like if i have alcohol i will drink as much as i can everynight until its gone, i smoke weed everyday and also smoke a pack of cigs every 2-3 days, and if one of my dealers happens to be selling m, acid or shrooms ill buy some without hesitation and do them the same night. Idk. I just felt like i needed to vent somewhere, do i have a problem? Or am i going to have one soon?

addiction,Kangaemma,2018/01/12,"Codeine addiction. Cold turkey. Hi, New to Reddit and very nervous. I have been addicted to codeine for about six years, I'm sick of it. I want to stop but I'm very scared of withdrawl. Ive stopped before with a taper method, withdrawl wasn't too bad considering I did it slowly but the restless legs drove me nuts and I relapsed. Its been one year since then and I want to do cold turkey. I know I'm in for a hell of a time. I take 15mg codeine about twenty tablets a day. Occasionally more. I had the last of my tablets at 10pm last night, I feel ok for now a little bit sick and an upset stomach with very mild body aches. I'm waiting for the restless legs to kick in. Does anybody have any advice? How long will withdrawl last or at least the worst of it. Thank you for reading and I am really hoping I can do it this time and stay off it. I have a supposedly non addictive muscle relaxant called norgesic. I plan on taking that with regualr panadol and magnesium. I really don't want to do the Valium route. I have weed available, I only smoke it socially but I figure if it helps I'll smoke it. Please if anybody has any advice I would really appreciate it. I am a 26 year old female.

addiction,Lady_under_the_Lake,2018/01/13,"1 year 8 months clean and I’ve got an issue I just started school again and I’m noticing during class I have extreme amounts of anxiety in class.
I also have problems taking in discussions in class and general studying at home.
I literally have to re read things over and over until they make sense in my head. I also have to review everything from class that we discussed.

Is this normal? Is my brain still recovering/healing? Advice for that stupid anxiety?

addiction,tootired__,2018/01/13,"Need Some Motivation to Quit - Adderall I've been abusing adderall since the fall of 2013. Started out around 20mg and now I'm up to 70-120mg per day. There's only been a couple days since I've started that I haven't taken any at all and those days, I was miserable and couldn't even keep my eyes open. I don't even really WANT to quit, of course. But I know that I need to sometime in the near future at least. My memory is starting to get really bad, it used to be perfect but now looking back on the past few years, and even just day to day, everything seems like a blur. I have at least a couple panic attacks every week now in which I feel like I'm dying. I ended up in the hospital the first time because I thought I was having a heart attack; arms went so numb that I couldn't even grasp anything with my hands, couldn't think straight, really dizzy, chest pain, cold sweats, feelings of intense fear/anxiety, forgot how to talk, shortness of breath, extremely fast heart rate, lips and hands were turning purple/blue. Now that I think back on that, it kind of seems like I had a mini stroke or something - not really sure? I went to the ER though and they did a bunch of tests for my heart/chest, told me I was just having a panic attack. They kept me there for another hour or two though because they said my heart rate was so fast they didn't want me to leave yet. That was a year or 2 ago and now I'm getting panic attacks like that quite often. It sucks. My depression is also worse than ever whenever I'm coming down. And my social anxiety is almost unmanagable. When I started taking adderall, I loved it because of the fact that it took away my shyness and I always loved talking to everyone and going out &amp; doing things with my friends. But now, even when I'm high, I just want to sit by myself and play games on my phone, watch movies, etc. I'm terrified to quit though because I have a toddler, I have a job that I can't afford to lose, I'm trying to get my life together and I know quitting should be the first step in that but I feel like if I quit, my life is going to be so hard to get back together considering I will be a useless mess that will only be able to sleep and do nothing else. I don't even know where to begin. I don't feel like I'm ever going to be able to stop.

Also, I forgot to mention, I'm 5'0"" and I was like 115 lbs. before I started, I'm now at 85 and can't seem to gain any weight no matter how much I eat.",4.951084896148418,4.418463621832358,5.7541896887813415,85.31508771929825,68.72709551656921,8.635316259998657,27.63117564025005,7.873277556716777,1.4493185319620894,1910,51,420,20,29,628,234,513,0.184,0.7240000000000001,0.093,-0.9938,2,0,1,0,0,0,59.0,0,0,4,12,39,30,5,4,19,0,41,21,12,4,6,77,100,35,1,10,12,0,9,7,1,3,5,1,0,0,19,22,2,5,15,2,0,9,12,16,1,3,22,14,52,14,55,66,8,74,0,4,3,2,15,24,1,11,47,260,71,3,0.11631278184329465,0.06890581343873342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051552131596203817,0.0,0.058235224834766126,0.0,0.0,0.09301528961743208,0.04839077605815263,0.06301242526612139,0.0,0.07909668018868128,0.060982046630483434,0.08897895974803655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0478577544828687,0.05177151779114693,0.0,0.2646451616102526,0.05463984366221037,0.13415602451691275,0.04855815722550387,0.14180638447092506,0.0,0.04948680525373318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050096581260225134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12869788080513764,0.0,0.18753030493140735,0.0,0.050090014283420435,0.0,0.06035715206666799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05950850667175527,0.04858220214994589,0.0,0.051509300625233734,0.0,0.06485974882530507,0.2304704863065741,0.10521157020969077,0.048999267616060965,0.05557092376301484,0.052267214214642484,0.0,0.0,0.06544210822595707,0.11762247461606075,0.1246408118838636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09893559281749427,0.0,0.0,0.044931483362899566,0.0,0.12153725576017588,0.0,0.09915485152598068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05209670318647495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2756624130170281,0.0,0.06144542001614797,0.0,0.0,0.05727233034497154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05771124431140402,0.051692072375913466,0.0,0.0605609317983452,0.0958836945885636,0.0,0.0,0.061579220866075736,0.0,0.0,0.08215515759353584,0.19888592508080752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04883672131285319,0.06506212561264378,0.0,0.0,0.10497682676776768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042751638887513634,0.08624445394289568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055802625575857405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08846111184650955,0.06188250027106629,0.2047019827563908,0.0,0.0,0.05551685566750991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3711388821409702,0.0,0.0,0.14902589281562129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0553200454460039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15883018228133594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09621513508389624,0.0,0.05819839077165415,0.05928311673761533,0.0,0.0447716309956756,0.05751815767657456,0.0,0.20581696411821665,0.0,0.0,0.04862134688130187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05481171019103672,0.0,0.04372636832092736,0.09348780819577036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038636521976829326,0.07452853410089598,0.17141507641318138,0.04616967825988405,0.03391145922771963,0.0,0.0,0.05557092376301484,0.06461389016508243,0.03948437195003824,0.06325745329470225,0.056810343476340786,0.0,0.0,0.0502284493105736,0.0,0.0,0.10290643843715916,0.0,0.04664954885792202,0.07081881671963293,0.0,0.1078231140566308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05926633078863376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07490161804273343
addiction,StonedZombieUK,2018/01/13,"I've relapsed. I have a tale to tell but here is not the place. 

I'm here to seek advice for one particular question that I'm struggling with.

I could write a book detailing my journey but I will spare you such an essay. The basic details are this:

Regular tobacco smoker by aged 15.
Also started drinking vodka aged 15.
Started smoking cannabis aged 16. 

Over the next few years this developed into other substance abuses including MDMA, Ketamine, Mkat, Shrooms, Pills, and an assortment of legal 'research drugs' . 

Naturally this addiction also created problems with family and authority including arrests, community service, curfews etc.

This lifestyle built up to the point of combustion. At the age of 17 I lost all my friends and I pushed away my family burning nearly all my bridges. I got arrested for the last time on a friday and was collected from the court by my grandparents on the Monday.

This was my rehab.

No friends to tempt me back to my old ways. No contacts for drug dealers. This was when my life should have changed for the better.

My relapse was gradual.

I had been ordered to do community service.

This gave me access to drug dealers.

At first it was just cannabis so I thought nothing of my decision. 

I moved on with my life got a job, got my own place started paying rent. Life was good. Life was stable.

At this point I'm still smoking weed but I don't touch anything else. I reconnect with family. Water under the bridge, all is forgiven.

Then on a night out I get offered cocaine and like the idiot I am I take it.

At first it was manageable. Only taking it on events like birthdays, new years and so on.

But then it became monthly. Then every weekend.

Now I sit here aged 22.

I'm not seeking advice about my addiction. I know what I must do. I know who to speak to what steps to take etc. I am ready to quit. 

I just need help to an emotionally painful question.

How do I tell my family I have relapsed?

They are so proud of the progress I made. How do I tell them I fucked up again. I can't bare to let them down. I've brought enough pain to them. But I can't quit my addiction without their support.

I need their support but I can't shake this feeling that I am a burden, a let down, A disappointment...

Thank you for your time.",1.7171058443764868,4.391267786697249,3.0937512742099926,87.26275059463137,85.58256880733944,6.073666326877338,25.96398233095481,7.457515093567415,1.6511090383961942,1769,78,336,31,54,574,222,436,0.122,0.7559999999999999,0.122,-0.589,3,0,8,0,1,0,60.0,0,3,6,8,20,20,2,2,23,0,34,17,0,3,4,43,62,23,0,6,11,0,2,2,2,3,14,1,1,0,20,12,2,0,7,4,2,6,9,10,0,3,18,3,56,10,53,38,8,64,0,2,0,1,23,24,1,2,33,234,76,8,0.0,0.09575246206518304,0.0,0.26430056580945993,0.0,0.15794280376699715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12925532035833534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06650379107301575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07592827508182885,0.06214168300808213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0714742270105083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08549146684362445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06452413550634335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07916785240833485,0.2811589411416586,0.0,0.06751049347297647,0.09090590458886323,0.0,0.08350341277549263,0.1802599905296606,0.0,0.0,0.06809005335667757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3047404468044536,0.0,0.04086245041102853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13748225476761236,0.0,0.0,0.1248748092949739,0.07471208882347467,0.042222458784373806,0.0,0.0,0.06778371840602719,0.19390521587996487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05416853557088877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08019633548881301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08882753012728281,0.06587494383504224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16527745666547686,0.22832786432246704,0.07896417296190374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08821902879415422,0.0,0.0,0.07646902878639192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06450569598153583,0.08589346754761536,0.0,0.11984647437392387,0.0,0.0780515507324366,0.08594758138973366,0.07583932534747599,0.0,0.07754409275410064,0.0,0.08480166118973094,0.0,0.05476227947913263,0.06146338627769137,0.17198553979694145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16886877603162606,0.0,0.15279243710479767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07732896157745678,0.0,0.0,0.1810624055109442,0.1719132245385715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17160364328292815,0.0,0.06453889736063108,0.0,0.0,0.08448529837737066,0.0,0.0,0.183415620937892,0.0,0.0,0.18228828084094287,0.0,0.21190739938489664,0.07440351803707089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06415801723423517,0.094247656365434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06414711973986582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07790269640459548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10408431425941374
addiction,Klownshuues,2018/01/13,"How do I help my girlfriend understand? I'm a recovering addict with ten days sobriety today. My girlfriend is not an addict, and has never done any drugs, nor is she friends with anyone who does. She tries to be supportive in my recovery - she says she's especially proud that I came to the realization I needed to get clean on my own. She never tried to steer me toward recovery because, for the length of our relationship, I haven't had addiction control my life the way it used to. However, I was still drinking, still smoking pot, etc. But I am much stronger than I used to be, so I decided it's time to get sober and stay that way. 

The thing is, after telling her how my addiction affected my life and described some of my worst moments from my past, I can sense her fear growing. She wants to understand, but she just doesn't - not really. I mentioned possibly going to NA meetings, but I am nervous since I have never been to one so I am admittedly dragging my feet. I did though, set up a few appointments with my therapist who is licensed to counsel for addiction. 

Here's how she seems to be ignorant about addiction: I decided a few months ago to quit smoking cigarettes. Since becoming sober, nicotine gum is just not cutting it all the time and I have had the occasional cig. Not being a smoker or an addict, she's conflicted. She even said, ""You're smoking again. You are **not** sober."" That's incredibly frustrating because it's a ridiculous statement and I'm proud of my ten days. She doesn't get that nicotine is not a mood-altering substance people use to get high - she just sees that I didn't kick the addiction and worries that will carry over to drugs and alcohol. She's also worried because I still haven't gone to an NA meeting, which is my fault for dragging my feet. But I worry that if I decide NA is not for me then she will fear my sobriety is in jeopardy.

How can I help her understand? How can I explain the difference between a nicotine addiction and being an *addict*? What can I do to let her know that even though it is hard, I am still making progress that I feel good about? I know she wants to be supportive but I see it causing her stress because she is always worrying about me.",3.8184885647994733,5.62969460092808,4.92765263506795,81.66685846867752,72.82830626450115,8.545203844879017,30.17971494862446,9.159459690764724,2.7179624925422607,1747,77,334,39,35,574,194,431,0.12,0.809,0.071,-0.9738,1,0,6,0,0,0,55.0,1,1,0,5,24,16,3,4,19,0,45,18,2,12,4,64,75,27,0,4,17,0,2,0,3,2,15,2,1,0,20,12,2,3,13,1,0,4,16,10,0,3,10,6,68,6,41,56,8,34,0,0,2,0,39,7,0,4,19,252,88,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6850994869300459,0.0,0.0,0.05570799362741991,0.06716182246757145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05025684681525459,0.052291786213394496,0.0,0.0,0.042736519514021375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04394244303999639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1532380702375354,0.06940698249791014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07187754176382986,0.0,0.06455877065062113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07048562285292738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0810592051858918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06565928725698036,0.0,0.0,0.05499577990792985,0.06431189987717602,0.0,0.06156383536318843,0.14575969274376094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0700884010488175,0.08301660206177541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14143541441009966,0.03177614515378925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048553623513702585,0.0,0.13133495084964733,0.0,0.03571606492241762,0.05271111383354948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0562964657185086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08424689326042953,0.06639882698751047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06907555622790855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06426291620819992,0.08877807481422144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041949294305184695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05016200296696522,0.0,0.046198051428056615,0.046598514376512544,0.14540901342452356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04258516374269226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05999233292552687,0.04356856995803085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07084790440271345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06684302485343918,0.0,0.0,0.04025989435471048,0.0,0.0,0.06747163906032219,0.0,0.0,0.05977965689786334,0.04997659097869667,0.0,0.0,0.10015810486164622,0.05721141239885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1039714938287776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06698403903899466,0.2007512863245637,0.0,0.0719883384211374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1426307364284212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05492899727650782,0.0,0.0,0.07296748663382177,0.041751195409917286,0.0,0.12348910625417453,0.0,0.07329044584815682,0.0,0.05956938342357235,0.0,0.0,0.08533478918793652,0.0,0.0,0.1962705023425174,0.0,0.16283280908880973,0.0,0.0,0.0741348099380354,0.09976632177209507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25528718531683897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,CounteredContinent,2018/01/13,"Concerns Regarding a Drug/Alcohol Rehab Hell everyone. I am new to this sub and still fairly new to reddit altogether but when I found this sub I really wanted to discuss an issue I'm having great difficulty with. Some short background: I'm a nurse and also hold a B.S. in Biology/Chemistry and a M.S. in Rehabilitative Sciences. This info is not intended to make myself sound all-knowing or intended to brag in any way. It is just background that is influencing my views. There is a drug and alcohol rehab here that has a long history and works with the legal system in their own county and surrounding counties. They call parole and probation officers to force clients into any recommended treatment if the client happens to be in legal trouble. There are some clients there who chose to go voluntarily and there is a very low rate of completion for people who seek the service of their own free will. The facility is so used to bullying and forcing their clients into a set treatment plan that they really have no idea how to handle clients they do not possess such leverage over. I feel that reporting to POs as a method of forcing compliance, and of course if someone fails a drug test, is violating HIPAA and unacceptable behavior from health care providers. I had experience with patients on parole or probation at times. Their POs are not interested in the well-being of their charges in most cases. The place I had the most trouble with them was a skilled nursing facility treating people who had been in accidents. I fought to keep POs away fro them because I was there to care for my patients, not play snitch for the legal system. The counselors at this rehab will not acknowledge that their policy is a problem and clients can not actually get the benefits they should because they can't trust their counselors. Phone calls to POs are not just for dirty drug screens or not attending. They also call if the client is doing something they dont approve of or if they feel the client is not in a good situation at home. They fight and bully until clients finally agree to do what the counselor says and this often results in misery, hatred and mistrust of the people they are supposed to be able to rely on for help, and relapse. A relapse is nearly guaranteed when a person in early recovery is trapped in a situation causing them to be upset, angry, depressed, and hopeless. I just do not understand how people trained in the field and working in such a specialty do not comprehend how detrimental their policies of usings the legal system to bully is to their client's success in treatment. They claim it is 'voluntary' and their clients always 'have a choice' and this is true, to a point. Clients must sign a consent form. The other part of that equation is if they do not sign it the counselor immediately informs the person's PO and then the PO threatens to revoke if the consent isn't signed. There is also a great deal of coercion in other aspects of life. ""Recovery first"" is used to justify some really awful actions. Clients are told they have to leave their children in the care of relatives in order to devote all of their time to attending counseling and services. People concerned for pets are told the same. Finances, losing their homes, sick relatives, and so on are all dismissed as being of concern and the mantra of 'recovery first' is repeated. I truly can not stand this place. They aren't helping anyone. The facility is making a lot of money and they also own a share in some housing units associated with the facility. Clients are 'encouraged' to live in those apartments at 400 per room. Each apartment has 4 bedrooms. I don't know what to do. This isn't right but I have no idea how to fix it.

addiction,chadian21,2018/01/13,"Give me a REASON to not go back to drugs I used to do everything under the sun whenever i had a spare moment, I kept that up for a lomg time but have been sober now for 6 momths. I quit jobs im not in that worse of debt than anyone i know (im 27). I have gone back to school and like the field im trying to get into.

I currently have no friends. No family to talk to. No prospects of dating and from it seems like the dating scene is a nightmare and i dont even know when to start. Dont have any currency on the sexual market at all. 

Give me a reason. Give me an exampl of going from nowhere to somewhere. I currently can’t find any meaningful reason to live out a life void of connection with anyone and being practically spit on just for not having money and looking nice.  Why should I not just get high and then die? Its a real question and I’d appreciate a real answer.

addiction,bel_tine,2018/01/14,"Addiction to mental state 'improvement'? I wouldn't say I have an addiction to a drug in particular, however the only one I have done more than all others combined is marijuana. I go through stages where I have no access to it (through moving somewhere new and no contacts etc.), and do just fine. I feel myself occasionally wish I had a joint, usually only when doing something that would be improved by it (watching a movie, walking on a beautiful trail) but apart from that I forget about it. 


But what stays with me is my compulsion to change my mental state. I drink 6 - 10 cups of coffee a day, because I feel myself 'improving' when I drink it. It gets me in the mood to start some project, fill out my budgets, etc. 


I would do the exactly thing with marijuana, when I had it. Smoking would help me become more creative, more interested in things. 


Once I was high, I would prepare myself a coffee, to further 'improve' my state. Once I have the coffee in hand, I'd want a few more tokes because it was wearing off a bit in the 20 mins it took to make the coffee. Afterwards, I would need to refill my coffee. 


I engage in these spirals of needing to one-up my current mental state 'for the better'. It's a never-ending chase for my 'best self', in terms of mental clarity, thought handling and processing, and creativity. 


I have taken speed in the past, and while it was never something I abused, I would say I was dependent on it. I knew that taking too much at once would only make me use it up faster, and I'd only need to take more next time. As such it was only ever used in standard, smaller quantities every day. This was easy to maintain. Even when I had been using it for months at a time, the dosage never increased. I had the product in my possession, within arm's reach, and I barely entertained the thought of taking more than my daily dosage. Since I wasn't going to take any more, I still needed to 'improve' my state further somehow. So of course making coffee will further improve my mental state. Smoking marijuana will increase the effects of the speed. I would sometimes become satisfied with my level, but within minutes I would tell myself that I'm coming down now, that the effects are wearing off. That the 'best' mental state had already happened minutes ago, and I was now experiencing less-than-ideal. 


When I don't use these products, I feel that I'm not smart enough, or my thinking abilities could be improved upon. So I do things like drink cranberry juice, or monster energy. Even though I know it is mostly placebo, I still feel my mental abilities improve, even if just by a fraction. And it pleases me. 


I have a case of beer that I bought two weeks ago, and I've only drank two since. Alcohol makes me feel less than ideal, the opposite direction I want to go. As such I rarely ever consume it, unless in a social setting. 


I had been a cigarette smoker for 6+ years, until I just stopped one day because I noticed it wasn't having any effect. I knew about cigarette's connection to dopamine, which is perhaps one of the reasons I started in the first place. But once I noticed that they weren't ""doing"" anything to me, quitting was as easy as not buying a new pack. 


I'm not sure really what I can do about my situation, because I'm not addicted to any drug *per se*, it has more to do with the fact that I'm not content to stay at my current, base, mental state. 


It's like having the choice to either be yourself, or yourself but 25% smarter with an improved thought process? For me that decision is obvious, and it is how I view this situation. 


Does anyone have this similar feeling, or know what I can do about it? Is it intrinsically bad?

addiction,Weavesnatchin,2018/01/14,"Marijuana. I used to do cocaine, shrooms, vicodin and pretty much anything I could get my hands on. However, I dropped all that shit and picked up weed a couple of years back. It's affecting my memory though so earlier last year I dropped it cold turkey. I thought I was ok but then I started doing all the strong stuff again. I get this overwhelming urge to use anything to get high. 

The thing is that last week I started smoking weed again and I do not have the urge to do anything else. I'm not sure if that is just a rationalization or if sticking just to weed is a possible route?

When I don't have access to standard drugs i tap into shit like chugging robitussin or inhaling whip cream cans. Im fuckin scared of just spiraling out of control.

addiction,fasttravelsnow,2018/01/14,"what do i do after 2.5 years I don't want to have a cigarette but I constantly feel like i want a cigarette. the only way I can stay stopped smoking cigarettes is by constantly distracting myself and moving and having a mint or food in my mouth. if I don't work all I do is sit around and want a cigarette so it's got to the point I am in so much pain from my back from work I am to scared to stop because my cravings for cigarettes will come back. i think it may be a mouth thing , i don't know where to go from here. worked non stop, spent 2 days crying in pain, back to sore then wam cig cravings so bad i could taste it. so tired from constantly fighting cravings. got sick (cancer but okay now) plus my mother died slowly and painfully  the course of my treatment with me trying to hide i was sick from her,  few months after i gave up but honestly to me giving up the cigarettes was harder than the chemo and radiation am cured, have no money problems , should be happy but ...such stupid 1st world problem. went to a drug counselling it was so bad , found out in the middle had thyroid problem which can be associated with continuing 'withdrawal symptoms' medication for thyroid has helped to an extent but feel the only way i can beat this is work 24/7 and never relax or do anything enjoyable again because i don't enjoy much with out cigarette. stupid i know. alcohol, drugs can take or leave, don't eat meat, never used to touch sugar now have to stop myself shoveling in my mouth. think its hard because of trying not to cross addict plus grumpy as shit all the time because i want cigarette. is so bad that i can not be around people smoking because if i inhale 2nd hand smoke i start craving as badly as when i first stopped. sometimes i feel okay but as soon as i relax it's back.  plus have never been so sick since i stopped (cancer totally not smoke related) had every scan mri etc lungs fine but never felt so bad. but have asthma since i gave up go figure...most of my friends say start smoking again stop torturing yourself but having had cancer once don't want to invite cancer into my body again . where do i go from here please? i feel like my body is betraying me by continuing to want cigarettes and yes i have read allen cars book, stopped by vaping/nicotine lozenges, which i no longer use. now not only still want to smoke, also have mint or food in my mouth addiction , have put on weight and feel like shit . where do i go from here please? i didn't post this on the stop smoking sub is because it is mostly newly stopped smokers or happy they have stopped long time non smokers on there and i figure my problem is an addiction thing rather than a cigarette thing plus the only way i can stop this is have something in my mouth thing. i know cigarette smoking can be considered 'only cigarettes' but addiction is addiction whatever you are addicted to and for me this is my addiction. smoked 1-2 packets per day cigarettes for 35 years before i stopped after waking up from an operation on my mouth , was urged to stop as the cigarettes would hurt the healing on my mouth and expensive teeth implants (nothing to do with cancer) and teeth implants might fall out but starting to think mints i suck to stop myself starting again will do as much damage to teeth as cigs.

addiction,lynfectious,2018/01/14,"Bromantane in recovery Originally posted in r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY

I need some input here. I’ve been to treatment before for depression and most meds don’t seem to work, at least not fully. I want to try Bromantane, a non-abusable medication approved in Russia with no dependence liability. At this point, I have TMS to try before other methods of treatment become addictive. In the past, the only thing that has worked for my depression was stimulants which I am obviously trying to avoid, as well as two antidepressants I used without a doctor’s prescription, not approved in the USA where I reside. These medications were also non-abusable. My depression has always been the sole thing that leads to relapse so I want to get it under control desperately. If TMS doesn’t work, the next option is probably ketamine which I want to avoid. Bromantane acts similar to a stimulant but lacks any tolerance, dependence, withdrawal, or abuse potential. I am not certain that it will work, I just want to try everything I can before I go to addictive options.

TL;DR: Is it okay to take non-abusable medication for depression that is not prescribed to you because it is not approved in your country if it may help treat your depression and prevent a future relapse?

addiction,BrandHoney,2018/01/15,"Been around too many addicts, I can see the signs. I'm not dumb, and I know what lengths an addict will go to in order to lie and cover up anything they're doing to protect themselves. I was with somebody for way too long with an addictive behavior and I know the selfishness and arrogance that goes along with being deep into addiction. This weekend I was around a close family friend with her mom&amp; son (3 y/o) downtown at an event. My friend's husband joined us in the evening, and I couldn't help but notice his constant removal of himself from the group. Always had an excuse to go away for 20 minutes at a time.... it happened about 3 times in the 2 hours we were all together. I know he is not stranger to alcohol binging and nicotine addiction, but I have a sneaking suspicion that its moved to something more or the frequency has increased. I'm sure my friend would know, but she's one to cover for him(or maybe in the dark herself)... like I used to be. idk... its just sad when you watch somebody spiral and there's nothing you can do.

addiction,fedtmandspa,2018/01/15,"I'm addicted to Reddit - How can I stop? Hi! I'm terribly sorry if this is the wrong sub, I just need some help battling my Reddit addiction. It sounds silly to a drug addict, but maybe you guys have some insights? Isn't some of the same mechanisms at play here?

How can I stop completely with Reddit? It has a considerable negative effect on my life. I can't focus, everything in my real life seems boring compared to all the shit I can see here and I have given up a lot of my social life to be on Reddit. I update the site sometimes many times pr minute and I spend multiple hours on here everyday. Sometimes I can't sleep because of feel drawn to my mobile phone to check reddit.

I have tried for several years. I've been on Reddit for 6-7 years. Once in a while I try to stop and delete my account. This process has repeated itself many times, so I have concluded that deleting the account doesn't work.

Do you have any ideas to what might help me???

Then I found out about the needles-I thought he was just snorting it. That’s when I knew this was bigger than me and decided not to walk away.
The past few months he’s spent a grand a month (if not more) on it. 
The other day he had a scare at work where he thinks he dropped his stash and his boss found it. He still has his job, but this is what he needed to scare him off it-mandatory drug tests
So he has decided to quit for good &amp; even though he’s morning, sweating, tossing &amp; turning, he is turning a corner and deciding to kick ole Boi out!

addiction,Flowolf66,2018/01/15,"The use of CBD in NA First off, I'm new to the fellowship and my recovery. I have almost 30days clean. I Used to be a heavy pot smoker and dabbled with most of the rave drugs that you can think of for years. 
I thought enough is enough, time to rise above and make a positive change in my life. 

I battle with the idea to whether I am truly an addict or not. But this isn't the point of this post.

I want to know other people's opinions about using CBD, as the medicine that it is,  while enduring the journey of the 12 step program of NA. 

I know some people would disagree upon it because I believe it is considered a mood altering substance although non narcotic non psychoative. 

Aren't caffeine and tobacco mood altering substances aswell? Which are widely accepted, promoted, and used substances in NA. 

Im not trying to look or think too deep into this but I would like to hear your opinions on the use of high quality regulated CBD extracted from industrial hemp. 

It has done wonders for me since I've quit smoking weed. 

I don't have any cravings to get high on marijuana or anything else for that matter. 
Also helps me with sleep and helps regulate my pain when I have any.

There is a very small percentage of 0.3% of thc in the  CBD (Federal Legal limit) that I have. It doesn't get me high but does help me relax and also takes away from my nicotine cravings.

I am a huge advocate of CBD. 
How does anyone who has a lot of clean time feel about it?

I'd really appreciate your thoughts and comments.

addiction,degener83,2018/01/15,"I am a degenerate gambler. Hey guys, throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

Like the title may suggest, I am a problem gambler, I am currently 18 years old, and my father is does also have a gambling problem - He doesn't know about my habit, however, my mother does. 

I am in this subreddit just to type and put my thoughts together, over the last few months, Iv'e made roughly £10K through betting in online casinos (blackjack, poker, roullete mainly). 

However, I had lost £5K, the few months before, so I am up around 5,000. I do not want to go back to how I felt, how helpless, hopeless, and lonely I felt when I had lost basically everything. 

I have lied, and stolen to fund my habit. 

What I am currently doing is withdrawing money from my bank account to give to my mother to put aside for me to save up. I feel powerless, and it makes me feel weak that I need to do this. I ultimately want to give up this addiction, it has made me fall behind at school, grades, socially too. 


EDIT: My mother asked me yesterday if I still continue to gamble, and I said no, knowing that I am still addicted, and I do. I have roughly 3,000 in my bank account at the moment, I feel like I will deposit this to an online casino and I can't withdraw it because my mom will know I am still gambling.",4.999767786561264,5.452378865612649,6.201380928853759,78.76554965415022,68.64426877470356,9.170849802371539,33.20380434782609,9.188382445141503,2.919600988142292,995,44,192,18,16,335,136,253,0.142,0.8240000000000001,0.033,-0.9714,5,2,0,0,0,1,43.0,0,0,0,2,13,11,0,0,8,0,25,3,0,6,1,36,47,14,0,6,3,5,7,2,0,3,3,1,0,1,10,9,0,0,10,4,14,4,4,8,0,0,10,8,38,3,28,34,3,29,0,5,0,0,14,10,0,3,17,134,48,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27532755407187137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1009860244605733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11241592180212806,0.11805469977664415,0.0,0.0,0.09710148105127007,0.0,0.07697908091102952,0.0,0.10745493018155468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22101685748118802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.113492269816611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1915527997742948,0.09021441621378792,0.2424970964398137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2422784553588451,0.07176780149278887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250369968622468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20820046181474536,0.10293500756521033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12338800260032015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2756989491804688,0.0,0.0,0.2389782699881217,0.08429284225450685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14789754252970694,0.20159089077891398,0.0,0.0,0.09363497733854066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1325095571688962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24166570114785035,0.0,0.2538924421017853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12983681287087778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1201211432130658,0.0,0.0,0.12780204365917516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12872649865602007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3025419758096086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10025216880506596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14896636387283205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08132014277341365

addiction,Attachmentville,2018/01/16,"Mindfulness Meditation to Deal with Triggers I don't have all the answers. I'm currently coming up on 10 months of sobriety from sex addiction, including 10 months of abstinence from the use of pornography. In addition to going to SA meetings, weekly therapy, remembering to take my depression/anxiety medication and practicing healthy self-care, a major factor in my recovery has been mindfulness meditation.

Mindfulness meditation can help you to stop living in fantasy, like many of us do. It's the practice of becoming aware of your thoughts, acknowledging them and gently releasing those thoughts. When you practice regular meditation, you will find that mindfulness will leak out of your meditation and improve your day through giving you the ability to recognize lingering or festering thoughts.

Notice - mindfulness meditation is NOT about ""clearing your mind."" When we try to focus on ""clearing our mind,"" it often has the opposite effect. Rather, the goal is to just concentrate on your breath.

Just sit in a comfortable position and focus on the breath.
When a thought comes (because it will), allow it to come. Recognize it and acknowledge that it's there.
Gently give yourself permission to dismiss the thought, as if to say ""I see, you - you're there. Now I will go back to my breath.""
Set a timer (I use the Insight Timer app) and start with a short amount of time like 5 minutes. Slowly increase that time.
When you meditate regularly, you will find answers in the stillness. A quiet mind is much easier to ""reign in"" and when you're triggered by a thought of a past sexual encounter, memory of getting drunk, smell or taste that brings you back, trigger location, provocative vision, etc., you'll be able to treat it with mindfulness. You'll be able to say ""I see you. It's natural to notice you. And now I gently give myself permission to dismiss the thought."" Being gentle with yourself is key. Don't beat yourself up.

I hope this was helpful.

addiction,SilkyPerry,2018/01/16,"In and out of Recovery I’ve been in and out or “recovery” going on almost 3 years now. I’m 23 and have a 2.5 yr old daughter and an on and off ex.

I have a Percocet addiction. I LOVE percs.  What drew me, and continues to draw me to the drug is the feeling. Every mg of that crushed up little blue (green, grey or yellow) pill is one of the best feelings I’ve ever felt. What sucks is that everything feels so perfect when I’m on a perc, in reality I destroy the people around me, but I feel good so I don’t care. Percs affect people in different ways, some people it fades them out and makes them feel good while being in and out of it, for me it was a little different.  Percs were like cocaine or adderall for me. They would give me laser focus and make my brain work in
Overdrive. I process things a lot quicker and they give me an unmatched energy.  I used to excel at school while consistently using them, which helped make them such a draw.  

last November I got a text from my ex
Saying that she wasn’t happy with our relationship bc of what percs do to me. Now I thought things were perfect bc I was feeling
Good, but didn’t realize how much I was hurting the people around me. She wanted out, and wanted me in rehab. We sat down with her and my parents and discussed options, I was
Able to stay out of rehab bc I have a great sales
Job and didn’t want to lose it. We set up a plan, I would have no access to cash, share location of my phone, submit to drug tests, go to NA meetings etc, etc. Long story short I play the game for 2-3 months until I stop getting drug tested and get my money back I went right back to doing percs. Have been caught 2 more times by parents or the ex and will shape up until they relax their rules then I go right back to percs. 

One of the things that makes recovery so difficult for me is my ex. We had a great relationship before and then the pregnancy really rocked us and I handled it terribly. I began to drink heavily and abuse drugs, and even woke up in at the hospital bc I overdosed even after that I only shaped up until the rules were relaxed. I also found out that when she wanted out she had just started another relationship, and kept that going secretly for about 6 months. I completely understood why bc of all I had done, but it still hurt like hell knowing she betrayed me and would be the main reason I relapse when I feel it’s hopeless. She used to be the one and only person I could trust and count on, and when I needed her most she was out. Now I can’t get back together with her even tho it’s all she wants, but I can’t and don’t think I ever will be able to trust her. 

I just wanted to share my story because I know how fucking hard recovery is. You have to be strong and have the right supper group around you to succeed. But ultimately it’s up to you, if you don’t have the willpower to stop or call someone and ask for help then recovery is going to be nearly impossible. I’ve got almost 10 days now on my newest recovery and I still have multiple urges every single day. NA meetings help, but that’s only an hour or 2 out of the day, the other 23 are all on you. 

If anyone ever needs anything don’t hesitate, I’ll do my best to help you anyway I can ",3.407896656534956,4.283502989473687,4.762370820668696,86.11954407294836,72.48872180451126,7.824988001919693,24.82562789953608,8.128838120801504,1.2824013757798751,2508,71,537,36,47,836,282,665,0.08800000000000001,0.7509999999999999,0.16,0.9954,6,0,6,0,1,1,59.0,5,6,8,10,35,34,4,0,30,0,55,13,1,11,8,120,110,62,0,14,16,7,9,2,0,5,8,1,0,1,25,48,2,3,17,6,3,7,10,10,0,3,29,14,88,24,85,69,14,100,1,4,4,2,61,46,3,14,46,380,113,7,0.12392240318638645,0.0734138919172701,0.0,0.0675468555534384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1240903862371131,0.0,0.0,0.04955035052811107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06497172236715312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043324712823656,0.0,0.05098878947467154,0.1654758178665868,0.05792535934224681,0.0,0.0,0.19057735755377228,0.0,0.037770973388129785,0.0,0.0527244188976712,0.0,0.13004891673940291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06916919277768553,0.06326931450429489,0.0,0.0631735745218751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0649651410092707,0.0,0.0,0.04947097764330397,0.0,0.0,0.11987954731588556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1294725357907567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06340782169954197,0.0,0.060698388685518925,0.2874212898741143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13820623696071574,0.12277436784688305,0.16814236256034154,0.10440996941395413,0.0,0.055686732710619566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21930611675922612,0.0,0.059492470343424135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06793725940134647,0.0,0.05728213244340631,0.09711651143447236,0.11887766106811185,0.17606989380931382,0.15591034850121707,0.09911206635512604,0.1366248869975057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06595885125981615,0.05550506620720149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1661251493673716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06101930243569902,0.0,0.13266149563513194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06148693181099558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06810451194041503,0.05050664914986575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06054222663450154,0.12420280357619265,0.0,0.054833713604670785,0.0,0.06931873552122571,0.0,0.0526771978409957,0.0559224035646806,0.0,0.16543833280028794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09891367993468426,0.0,0.04554861251822672,0.09188689174763633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06501785807606497,0.0,0.1259595413041465,0.14137285767090207,0.0,0.0,0.1376011635108043,0.0,0.0,0.17182438216746065,0.054102131276218365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039693932347842985,0.06370643486135541,0.0,0.19956942653614945,0.0,0.15874358283099987,0.0,0.049274034447437685,0.0,0.06270804396298871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05249952503821353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04385645740021657,0.06604239669814327,0.09896459126174223,0.10360467794171664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12349280736616686,0.03970223609725323,0.0,0.0491902729316153,0.03613007492777496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07453169643508055,0.16054375232666773,0.0,0.0,0.21927793235425674,0.04918191776813912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0574386546396054,0.05591034698945766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04510849271419401,0.0,0.0,0.13204637957424745,0.0,0.0,0.039900982348224326

addiction,Mithriark,2018/01/17,"Trapped I'm a 35 year old addict. Currently i'm addicted to phenibut, klonopin and most recently meth. I've been depressed and anxious most my life, also diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar disorder. Mental illness runs in my family. Recently i got laid off from my job and that's when i started using meth to kill the boredom. 

I feel trapped. I started using phenibut to control my behavior at work. I disliked my call center job so much i would lose my temper, pound my desk, make a scene etc. Phenibut eliminated that side of me and probably saved me from getting fired. However a negative side effect started showing up in that I could only sleep about 5 hours on average a night. Raising the dosage didn't help so I started illicitly obtaining klonopin and the side effect went away. The combination of 3 grams of phenibut a day and 2 mg of klonopin every other day worked well for about 6 months until I got laid off. Now I'm in a situation where I'm unemployed and addicted. Even if i were to flush all the drugs and get completely clean, my only work experience the last 20 years is in call centers. I can't deal with the stress of a call center job without something to take the edge off. 

Regarding the meth, I know I could stop using it if I could just get back in some kind of routine. I need to find work but having all these addicitions weighing on my mind is creating so much self-doubt. BTW, I saw a Dr and asked him about phenibut addiction and he had no idea what it was. He prescribed me wellbutrin and atarax neither of which was any help.

addiction,keepin_ur_lights_on,2018/01/17,"Looking for advice. My stepson is addicted to pills.  Xanax for sure, and I suspect opioids as well.  I am shopping around for in-patient programs in Florida.  What should I look for?  Can anyone recommend a facility?  I called one place and the admission counselor was really awesome on the phone.  After our conversation, I started thinking that the guy was kinda like a car salesman.  Then I started reading the Google reviews...  I'm just not sure who to trust.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",3.818522727272725,7.026931988636362,4.827727272727274,74.69909090909091,81.38636363636363,6.836363636363638,34.13636363636364,8.00094639256281,3.4191909090909087,397,23,59,8,11,129,68,88,0.023,0.732,0.245,0.9631,0,0,1,0,0,0,16.0,1,0,0,0,3,6,0,0,6,0,8,3,0,0,2,12,14,4,0,2,2,0,0,1,0,2,3,0,0,1,3,3,0,0,2,2,1,1,1,0,1,1,2,2,8,6,11,9,0,9,0,0,2,0,6,4,0,1,5,43,11,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2258810066313242,0.0,0.40495122735510336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14090461651056624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14488061160564716,0.0,0.0,0.1844539073733567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21157663568510093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22844118170291766,0.0,0.20516277647989686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10122853968445647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34799536323425584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14040558834546746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21648222168084014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20725829428112094,0.0,0.13273904939650516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29331759898156906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3905712849810108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13276681766580845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18629968193948987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14719051388289556,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,thefamilyjules42,2018/01/17,"Loved ones of addicts: What were some subtle signs that they were addicted? What happened that made you know? I think my (ex)boyfriend is addicted to something, probably either opioids or benzos, but I'm not sure how to get his friends to listen to me about it. I've tried pointing out behaviors and things that I've noticed that makes me think it, but they all do their own drugs and are in denial. Plus, they don't live with him and don't see the same things that I do. I feel like the people that can help him just aren't listening to me. 

We broke up after the last time he lied to me and we aren't on speaking terms. I'm still trying to move out of our apartment. He doesn't respect me and I don't trust him so his friends are the only people that can help him.

What are your stories? I'm hoping to compare my experiences with yours. I'm also open to advice on what else I could do.",3.0706323185011684,4.36266090710383,3.693649492583919,91.86258196721312,73.80874316939891,6.540046838407495,24.00039032006245,6.868970318607317,0.6285209992193597,698,20,153,6,14,220,104,183,0.084,0.787,0.129,0.8724,0,0,3,0,0,0,19.0,3,3,4,0,6,9,0,0,4,0,18,5,0,3,2,33,35,12,0,2,6,0,1,1,2,0,4,3,0,0,15,13,0,0,4,0,0,1,7,1,0,1,3,5,28,8,22,31,6,15,0,1,1,1,26,9,0,3,6,107,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4996266548609147,0.0,0.14928540630205908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12217038419086795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1219746839439904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17716509083338458,0.0,0.12762001442792814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1494387049995496,0.0,0.0,0.07724527318265567,0.10913916006958303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2360599685186499,0.0,0.07981619629845102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13509430545745024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20479747474705515,0.0,0.0,0.15173541628936404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08395858253486749,0.12452821554373973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07463587047190981,0.0,0.1348990074320404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1378811946950366,0.14455498775039138,0.10197538696846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1623706923736127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1739300424913731,0.0,0.0,0.10352113482966388,0.11618872622651062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21182343372977772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14441734924954974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16471226319669288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12173818023002615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11761006995925895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12200258935484233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14398423570445984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20298764872408792,0.19577812812792136,0.0,0.0,0.08908161269751125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2074420629344475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,Hyde98X,2018/01/18,"Why do so many people get mad when you call marijuana an addiction? White not being as bad for you as things like cocaine, it's the level of addiction and lifestyle lived that's comparable. And I've seen it. My city especially is one of the most pothead ridden cities in eastern Canada and you see what addiction, to something viewed as so basic, can do to people. And it's already been proven what long-term use from a young age does to the brain (rather than purely in adults), which is the most common form of use. Most people who smoke weed have been doing it since a young age, and I've seen the lifestyle it's created for these people.

While the substance by itself isn't necessarily harmful, it can be just as addictive, if not more in some cases. There's nothing in it alone that should be chemically addictive, but you see it time and time again in people who try to wean down or quit. They're angry, short-tempered, and can hardly focus without getting their ""fix"". They become on-edge if they haven't smoked, many of them not even being able to become ""high"" anymore. It's just become a complete state of existing for these people and they're no longer sure how to live when they're not on it. I've seen people so desperate to get pot when they ran out that they've resorted to robbing people or other gross lewd acts.

People make up excuses all the time, laughably going as far to call it their ""medicine"", despite being perfectly healthy individuals. They rave about the ""health benefits"" an about how it ""cures cancer"" when there's nothing wrong with these people medically to begin with. Going as far as making up ""pain"" to justify their use, when this ""pain"" is nothing more than withdrawal symptoms. But if you dare use that term, then they lose their shit at you. If it's not an addiction and they can ""quit any time they want"", why do they get so mad when you question them about it? Why can most of them hardly go a day without it? I've only ever known a small handful of people who were able to make it out and successfully ""quit"". After a few months of emotionally destructive withdrawals that is. 

Well over half of my relationships have been with potheads (due to lack of selection here), and dating these people while not doing it yourself isn't exactly fun. Some days all they want to do is sit inside smoking pot, other days when you're actually gonna do something, like a date, they literally can't leave the apartment without having done it. When they were off the influence (rarely), they were bitter, miserable, and were always lashing out at me for the smallest things. Then once they ""got their fix"" would apologize.

Considering they share literally all the behaviors of addicts, especially denial, why isn't this a conversation we're having? Soon this will be legal Canada-wide and I'm concerned that this is something that will be even more normalized.

[Also I'm prepared to have many of the people I'm talking to lash out in the comments here to prove my point.]",7.496011056651088,7.292764637809189,7.250079790265591,75.6027111592386,63.39929328621909,10.059409552034651,32.39234013450359,9.536714749202195,2.8311052775561376,2379,80,435,39,31,754,258,566,0.11,0.8220000000000001,0.067,-0.9889,0,1,6,0,0,0,84.0,0,7,22,6,31,22,5,1,25,0,47,16,3,10,9,73,75,47,0,11,20,0,3,2,0,5,13,0,0,1,44,20,0,0,3,0,0,6,15,13,1,2,13,11,33,9,72,50,16,67,0,2,7,0,43,25,1,13,36,298,77,2,0.11564040004656105,0.0,0.056424174558595476,0.4412278682521136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05988428956416465,0.0638060285160453,0.04623879306875454,0.048111038299020095,0.0,0.0,0.039319718754974066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0573421016718754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0482774518680708,0.0,0.19157360466992587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06454646551421915,0.11808177781936535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060623379649069074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11186773700764197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050598846683824826,0.05917013936848475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06503994264002957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0763793936001659,0.05230168118998045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12083467228565975,0.0,0.09858165642078824,0.0,0.0462440959344112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10359108435232084,0.0,0.0,0.06146016883029942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0610902158738623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06122324324683893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05649605824052024,0.0,0.10211259187145527,0.05116905752501804,0.0,0.06468601399167273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11578629749025325,0.1758618227530805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05824776852989734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046151532021697264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05665151963194433,0.16644012402526734,0.0,0.0,0.061576625977604924,0.039180463934313015,0.043974867595704736,0.12304953890396655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5211082039021393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054658778162270286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06477185680048933,0.18449669986157888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06207725621920576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09215042682404342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05935160442529658,0.04782946695671821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13353844445193486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05449485424798186,0.060097326783369924,0.0,0.046473686588462834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07682634336487353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13486169444522547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039256120398197335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19975235326479288,0.0,0.0,0.0682077040869143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05198730374779845,0.0,0.20869494865681207,0.0,0.0,0.1672098285113788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0410738111539558,0.06321731195839378,0.0,0.0

addiction,pillhead123,2018/01/18,"Thoughts on being 6 months off oxy Hello there all,

I was using about 90mg of oxy daily.  It seemed sustainable, it didn't seem to be interfering with my life, and it gave me a pick up during a long day at work.  There was also not a financial burden since it was almost free for me.  Perfect storm, right?

I did not use socially, it was just for me.  I wasn't hiding it as there were a few friends who also casually used, but I was not open about it with my GF.  It took about 9 months for her to find one, and then it was out.  

It was difficult because I didn't feel like I was an addict, but I knew that I couldn't just stop because of the physical dependency.  For myself I went to a doctor for medical assistance (suboxone), and for my GF I went to addiction talk therapy.

The talk therapy was helpful and it forced me to introspect on the things that being on a drug all the time DID take away, mainly spending quality time with my GF.  It did not stop, but it definitely was not a priority because I felt great all the time.  It's funny how many little things this affects when you take a good hard look at it.

I tried to stop without Suboxone, and it was truly hell.  I went on Suboxone and everything was better.  I didn't feel sick, and I didn't feel high.  It was a relief...but from what I read, people said that it was trading one dependency for another.  I didn't like the prospect of that, but I persevered and did not touch oxy during treatment.  It took about 3 months to wean off, and in the first 2 - 3 days there was mild anxiety.  After this I just said screw it, and have not thought about it again.

Suboxone is amazing.  TAKE IT AS PRESCRIBED.  DON'T SLIP UP.  It can be so easy to say, ""What's one going to do, it's been 6 months..."".  This medication removes the physical dependency fairly quickly without disrupting your life.  Ending it was about as serious as a hangover, and then you're free, physically.  If you're hooked on oxy or any opiate, TRY THIS without using.  It's a miracle...at least it was for me on 90mg a day.

Now, I'm having a hard time in therapy, however, as they are pressuring me to do 12 steps, go to group meetings, and put on a mantle of ""addict"" for the rest of my life.  I don't drink other than weddings and social events, I don't use anything else and never did, and only started using because of availability.

I don't have cravings, I'm not 'high' on my ability to get over this, and I don't think I'm being delusional.  I get sick thinking about where this could have led, and I'm rebuilding trust with my GF.  

I don't want to feel like I'm broken for the rest of my life, and I feel like reading through the addiction literature and 12 steps, they're conditioning me to accept that I have an unbeatable weakness.

Is this last bit denial of addiction, or is 12 steps not for everyone?

addiction,abandonuser123,2018/01/18,"Need advice for addicted brother. To start off I am not looking for final answers here, but only suggestions. Me and my family are planning to have a discussion about this later this week and I just want to get some advice from people who have already gone through similar situations. 

My brother has been struggling with addiction and depression for a very long time now and this has lead to some very bad behavior. It got to the point that I stopped talking to him or only had very surface level conversations with him so he wouldn't blow up at me. Eventually, one thing lead to another and he was sentenced to jail for about two months.

While in jail, my sister and I reconnected with him over email and had some of the realest conversations we've had in half a decade. He really seemed to want to get clean. But then he got out and started hanging out with his old friends and girlfriend again, who were toxic. To keep things short, he's spiraled down again and now may be worse than I've ever seen him.

His toxic relationship ended with a huge fight and now his ex is actively trying to destroy his social life. He's now very, very paranoid and seems to be going insane.  Along with this he can't hold a job, has started selling again, and is talking about getting an ""illegal job,"" where he would have to lead a double life.

I think he's doing meth and other ""harder"" drugs again. He's very resistant to counseling, but I truly believe the only way he'll ever get out of this is if he goes to rehab.

So, for the redditors who have been a similar situation, what did you do? I'm thinking about calling the cops on him and getting him sent to jail. That really does seem to be the only thing that has helped him in the situation. What else can we do?

TLDR: Brother relapsed and is now worse than I've ever seen him. Need advice.

addiction,Giantshitsandwich,2018/01/19,"Home rehab is like doctor assisted suicide So several days ago, at the urge of my counselor, I tried to go to rehab. 

Background: former meth user and cook for 12 years. Currently a very talented drunk. I drink 2 to 3 pints of vodka a day. 

Counselor convinced me to go to a detox. She suggested my local major hospital. I gave in and went. They said they're not a real detox center and do I have 3 options: get transferred to a detox center which will cost about 12k. They could put me in an involuntary psych hold, it'd cost about 7k. Or they could send me home on a bunch of Librium and phenregan. I chose option 3 because I can't afford any other option..

Funny thing is, Librium and vodka combine fantastically. So I did 5 days off Librium along with my vodka. And here I am just as drunk as before but now also craving Librium. Thanks doc.

addiction,JeremyMcG1,2018/01/19,"So, this just happened... Yes, I'm going to Reddit in the hopes that someone has a decent answer to this... incoming wall of text: 

I have a 4 year old kid who is in pre-school.  A very good, very expensive preschool.  I'm recently divorced and found myself flirting with one of her teachers.  Most likely about 1/2 my age - but in every single way, she is 'my type.'  

It never went anywhere - but the flirting was fun.  

Fast forward to the end of last year.  She gets fired from her job as a pre-school teacher for some BS violation of policy (she didn't report when a boy went into the girls bathroom.)  Anyway, I've used her as a babysitter a few times since then.  

I am totally and completely attracted to this woman.  So, I call her up because I was taking my daughter to an aquarium and just wanted to see if she would want to go with us.  She did, and we all 3 had a great time.  Kinda ended the night with a ""If you ever want to hang out, call me thing.""

So, again, being a divorced dad and coping with all the stress of that, I decided to call her last week to see if she would want to go out.  She said yes and we made plans for this thursday and friday night as I don't have my daughter those two days.  

Thursday, she calls me up - says she is sick as a dog and can't make it.  I offer to be her ""doc"" and she said she just wants to be alone and rest - can't keep anything down and basically is suffering from a terrible flu.  

Thursday night, she calls me and said, ""Can I come over and sleep on your sofa and watch movies.""  - Of course, I said yes.  I went and picked her up.  We hung out, watched some movies and fell asleep on the couch.  

This morning, I get up and go to work.  She is still passed out on the couch.  

I have security cameras inside and outside the house.  My system pings me that there is a car in my driveway.  I open up the cameras and see her walk out of the living room, and get into the back seat of some car for 3 or 4 minutes.  

When she gets out, she goes back into my house, gets on the sofa and breaks out a drug kit - unrolls some aluminum foil, pops a glass tube in her mouth and starts burning whatever is on the foil and smoking it... like a lot.  

Then she passes out on the sofa and goes back to sleep. 

She brought drugs into my house.   Smoked them on my sofa.  Violated my trust.  Introduced my house (the outside at least) to a drug dealer - and I had ABSOLUTELY ZERO IDEA WHAT-SO-EVER she was using.  None.  Completely escaped me...

Lots of details left out - but my question is this:

1) Do I try to 'help her'
2) Can I even help her?
3) Should I help he when i have a kid?
4) Do I go home, tell her what I saw, call her an uber and tell her to have a nice life?

addiction,finding_bliss,2018/01/19,"How to deal with life??? I quit weed bc I had to. I fucked up my life. I’m drinking pretty heavily  now instead. I signed up for a substance abuse program bc I know if I keep drinking I’ll prob turn into an alcoholic. I’m currently drinking almost every day, after I get home from work around 9, about 4-6 beers til I pass out. This place keeps telling me I should be quit, but is not offering solutions on how to do so. I feel judged that I haven’t quit yet. I feel like a failure. How do I stop? I don’t see myself as an addict and I would like to drink with friends maybe 2 times a month, and would like to stop drinking alone, but I have no idea where to start. Don’t know what this treatment center is for if they’re just telling me things I know I should stop doing??",0.51035868005739,2.500460853658538,1.9869870875179352,97.99933285509329,83.75609756097559,5.078335724533716,20.012912482066,6.2272716619740125,-0.13902395982783355,596,17,141,5,17,192,101,164,0.161,0.74,0.099,-0.8476,1,1,7,0,1,0,21.0,0,0,0,4,11,5,1,0,5,0,15,11,0,3,0,33,29,12,0,6,6,0,2,3,1,4,4,0,1,0,5,7,7,5,6,6,0,1,5,1,0,0,1,3,22,4,21,23,0,22,0,0,1,1,5,9,1,3,15,85,27,2,0.0,0.13476870395059545,0.0,0.12399835972643085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1215583427092387,0.11389874647124144,0.11780506059438885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1012567736461267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07335583134661644,0.11726564685199008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5571318289633224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0958346975617142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11502533435413788,0.08125913639044732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08787876489956463,0.10515501286355566,0.05942683796583601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.114095067843436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12840376320332333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20220278234771502,0.0,0.0,0.18753310649448976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16068229310698434,0.16670953966742902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.114271698826863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09078982260471548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11883885590332426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11571910942633501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3629440219603823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0906396877612909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08050898500725431,0.0,0.0,0.28528663590996817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19883551786691167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07556683147795225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06632536764487605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1237214187061638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08280739437036591,0.0,0.0,0.1616017438647139,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,PM_ME_4THROWAWAY,2018/01/20,"Worried about substance abuse long term. So throwaway for obvious reasons. I have used cocaine casually for 4 years. Picking up the pace recently to about every weekend; I'm a recent college grad and have a well-paying job so I can afford it now. I drink heavily, to quantify it in one medium about a quarter of a fifth of whiskey every night (I know that's not ridiculous but it's not healthy). 

I'm becoming very concerned about my substance abuse between alcohol and blow. The blow is only a weekend thing, but I drink the above amount every night. I know this is a paragraph but I've been using tonight so a bit amped. I'm just looking for some advice/words on my concerns. I've gotten myself into trouble with my drinking before and sought therapy, but I'm concerned I'm slipping into a deeper, more drastic hole.",3.3933333333333344,5.828071815286624,4.425757961783443,81.97439065817413,76.07006369426752,6.224883227176223,31.485774946921445,7.3011,2.2752814437367306,653,33,111,8,15,212,98,157,0.095,0.884,0.02,-0.9126,2,0,6,0,2,0,19.0,0,0,0,0,9,3,1,0,11,0,6,5,0,4,1,21,17,10,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,6,5,0,3,7,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,1,10,1,18,15,5,16,0,0,1,0,0,5,0,1,11,69,16,3,0.0,0.34580183382424495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1559527419693089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15811301777978465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16116610351947047,0.12417405116376468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1593156724174762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4288619000328108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36885211316918187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1448111060535313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16039651696466298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12914176203365146,0.12254283742665473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2738872423280139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09888464620047407,0.11098488346652093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15003837438755346,0.288172755624545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16688148153176388,0.0,0.09694813460157237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2520700215982205,0.0,0.12040595192264428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13120687255353114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14819705257034751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09397290149767253

addiction,boobydharma,2018/01/20,"Psilocybin as treatment My girlfriend is battling a cocaine addiction. She was clean for three months and is now dealing with relapse, as is common. I worry. I've done cocaine too and have dealt with quitting, though I don't classify myself as an addict. I can usually stay away from it except in rare instances. She on the other hand was very deep into that lifestyle and has triggers and temptations everywhere.

I've been reading that psychedelic mushrooms have been tested and show some signs of being an effective treatment. How would a psilocybin treatment go? Is it simply a dose, or are the patients undergoing simultaneous therapy?

Has anyone tried mushrooms to kick an addiction? I just want to help, but I'm powerless, and I know that.",6.0504545454545475,8.549273439393943,6.253636363636367,71.60045454545455,68.39393939393939,9.042424242424243,35.484848484848484,9.573946990214177,4.000112121212122,602,31,90,14,11,192,93,132,0.06,0.866,0.07400000000000001,-0.327,1,0,2,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,2,5,1,1,0,8,0,18,5,1,3,0,21,22,13,0,2,4,0,1,0,1,1,4,0,1,0,6,9,0,0,2,2,0,1,1,1,0,1,5,1,9,0,15,15,1,11,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,2,4,71,15,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6455144255568261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13801149282047345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1854434050220756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2034883548250596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20198652360068275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11217463337505436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13229851027827513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10847394879412008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1575454716078175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20993611202414172,0.19743170791561995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2103789999682568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2257192815022482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19392317224707148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1340069057451805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21738430604696626,0.16285776412765435,0.11641883201848464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2004472390818436,0.0,0.14021187738552618,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,P_One_Archie,2018/01/21,"Need some sober veterans to give me some simple advice. I think I have been battling with addiction for a while now. I'm familiar with the steps and have had long periods of clean time(+3 years) and also periods of serious bingeing. When I was younger, I primarily use to do drugs, drink, and/or watch porn and masterbate(PMO) because they were fun. As I got older I began to do those same things to cope with boredom, stress, anxiety, anger, depression etc. and also to fill something up inside me. I think I have a problem. Now, when I do have addiction problems or face failures due to addiction reasons, I feel like I'm less of a person and that I don't deserve and am not worthy of some of the pleasures of life.  I don't feel this way when things are going well and have been working on adopting a healthy mind set with lifestyle changes. But when these feeling do arise, I resort to drinking and PMO now.



I think I have low self-esteem. What should I do? What advice can you give me? I've read up articles about this online but I just want to hear something from someone.

addiction,TheSkonz,2018/01/21,"I have an addiction to strip clubs. After being hooked on strip clubs for about 16 years, as of tonight I can finally come forward and say it.

I don't go every night. But I've noticed I'm now averaging about once a month. The financial impact hasn't ruined me yet - keyword: YET - but I'm now officially worried that it could get to that point.

If I had to venture a guess, I'd say this whole addiction stems from a deep-rooted need to be wanted and desirable. Clearly the fact that I wasn't the big man on campus in my younger years in the past is screwing up my present.

That said, I've officially realized that I have a problem, and I do not want this to continue to screw up my present and subsequently ruin my future.

One big, BIG fly in the ointment: there's a strip club within walking distance of my house.

I'll take any advice, treatment suggestions, referrals, etc. at this point. I am actively choosing to NOT let this problem of mine ruin my life. I'm admitting that I have a problem. I need help.

addiction,sickboyAIA,2018/01/21,"I’m addicted to Ativan I’m 19 and I started taking benzodiazepines when I was 14, they were prescribed for panic disorder and insomnia, which only got worse over time. I was taking Ativan as needed for 5 years, and it worked. This June my doc put me on a daily dose of klonopin, I took it everyday until August because it wasn’t as strong as I needed it to be, so he put me on Ativan, 1.5mg daily. Ive been on benzos everyday since June, and given those past years of taking it as needed, I am extremely dependant on it.

It’s the only thing that’s ever helped me, I’ve tried antidepressants, CBD, kava. Benzos are the only thing that make me feel like I can breathe. I have abused them in the past but now that I have this dependence I don’t abuse them as often, but sometimes I can’t help it and I’ll take a high dose just so I get forget the day ever happened.

So basically, I’m lost. I can’t imagine life without Ativan but it’s also controlling my life. Does anyone have advice? I’m sorry if this post is a mess, I haven’t been sleeping well and yes, im on Ativan right now.",2.5086666666666666,3.914320688888889,4.546333333333333,84.73150000000003,75.44444444444444,7.133333333333333,22.277777777777786,7.793537801064563,0.9863777777777778,845,22,174,12,18,291,124,225,0.116,0.821,0.064,-0.8797,0,0,0,0,2,0,27.0,0,0,3,4,12,6,0,1,7,1,19,8,2,4,2,25,39,21,0,4,6,0,1,1,0,0,6,0,0,0,19,6,0,1,2,0,0,3,6,3,1,0,10,1,24,3,20,28,0,31,0,1,0,0,6,9,0,4,19,110,43,1,0.0,0.2836546088492993,0.0,0.13049285626078788,0.0,0.11697141581746222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09572565171477193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08369842647322859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07296923240590977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13425597926828306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07719789178601699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1371888704659705,0.0,0.10475203294391316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21655463672006106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060524931359330424,0.08551513768624605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06253935811584772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0957366299483557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10585208942836036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16046746410384782,0.12647174244418682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12929870847892655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16909813504245966,0.058480354216295535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1306688808097493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0799020191437817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2662725642555359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2731163108048893,0.0,0.1404445139235056,0.0,0.0,0.22853822040592095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11464143397199167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24066715781189216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10222485989891833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0990187371195873,0.0,0.11978845431285914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11838834565089038,0.13399659663847344,0.08472569662559973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3600040485263599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1590493890385503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06979920287350276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1329933341350374,0.08126980527634718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10762647988566666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11538846312854338,0.0,0.08714448670726432,0.0,0.12198657151570015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15416833578912692

addiction,Jamminjake22,2018/01/22,"""Love, your son"" a letter from a recovering addict with co-occuring disorders to his parents, alcoholics in need of help. Input appreciated. Already lost my sister and uncle to alcoholism, and my best friend a month ago to suicide. Can't stand to lose them too. Very emotionally exhausted at this point. The night before last having stayed up all night writing Memorial in my friends name.  Then last night writing a plea, originally an email to not being able to call sometimes after a realization that saved me. It was now my duty to help save them. My dad jobless since my sister passed years ago drinking into oblivion daily, my mother the functional addict drinking to stave away the pain of all ages suffered. I, their son having struggled with chronic major depression, social/generalized anxiety disorder, and drug addiction with 9 major suicide attempts. Most recently in August. Hoping to update with more background later. Please give me the bravery and courage to help my family heal.

addiction,BrokenSymmetry941,2018/01/22,"Help? I'm a 32yo from the UK. I used cannabis daily for 12 years, sometimes heavily, sometimes very heavily. I also used synthetic weed for a couple if years, which caused me the worst problems. 

I stopped the synth 18 months ago. I've used a bit of weed on and off since, maybe a bag a month, and I've stopped that too, for 2018. I'm educated, professionally pretty successful, and a homeowner and landlord. I'm experiencing on going mental health problems - I can't connect to people, I can't sleep properly. I'm constantly depressed and hopeless and I'm having a hard time going on right now. Can anyone relate or give any advice? I'm in so much pain right now. Thank you for listening, much love.

addiction,Dyldogirl,2018/01/23,"Books for my husband Hello reddit. Please redirect me to an appropriate sub if this post is misplaced.

My husband had just over 2yrs sober until a relapse this weekend. A collection of factors lead him to drive around until he found a dealer and purchase meth and a needle. He didn't save the guy's number, but this is the first time since we've moved to a new city that he's slipped up.

He credits NA to saving his life in the beginning of his recovery, and after our discussion has decided to go back (because it ""couldn't hurt""), but doesn't feel like he's an addict, since he no longer puts meth ahead of the other factors in his life. He's also going to talk to his psych and his therapist about what happened, for the medically- and spiritually-framed advice they might have for him. -mostly his words, I'm trying to summarize.

So, I'm wondering if there's a book that would be beneficial for him to read that doesn't start out by forcing the reader to admit that he's an addict, like the basic text does. In NA, they say the only requirement to attend is a desire not to use, but to use their texts, you have to admit that your life is out of control on step 1. We're searching for tools that he can gain and use the next time he feels the way he did, in an effort to prevent this singular act from becoming a pattern.

A little more about him: He does drink occasionally. He doesn't smoke weed per his job's requirements, but likely would if it were legal. He defines himself as Christian but doesn't attend any church currently, and he practices meditation and is very interested in Yoga and eastern religions. He's in a place where he believes the conquering of his past demons (and they are many) is the appropriate next step to working on aspects himself, including his past/present drug use, but he's feeling lonely and weary and a little lost.

Thank you for your help.

I think maybe I should add, I don't agree with his assertion that he's not an addict. I fully acknowledge the chance of relapse, and did when we were married less than 1 yr ago. But I've backspaced a lot already in this post, and maybe my venting and requests for support for me should be left for another post.",6.987849342770474,6.423180072093025,7.123629929221437,77.28868048533876,64.55813953488372,10.082912032355917,33.5793731041456,9.43228470229965,2.8861688574317497,1741,64,336,28,23,562,225,430,0.049,0.8490000000000001,0.102,0.9678,2,2,5,0,0,0,49.0,2,4,4,11,10,12,0,0,30,0,30,9,0,6,0,65,52,31,0,9,13,2,3,3,0,5,8,1,0,1,16,21,1,4,10,6,2,11,10,3,0,1,8,4,35,9,56,36,4,52,3,3,0,0,56,19,0,7,21,207,51,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31378623655032994,0.0,0.09375741938438073,0.08505042941256181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1058789082204494,0.07672806224446156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0652466387602369,0.10060785251334613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08541237157691789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0737766292111046,0.0,0.05848785258368994,0.10596493036812354,0.0,0.10809839986006907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10761171064869676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16792615897571705,0.0,0.0,0.09399065184329704,0.1112670162006883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1455396944546631,0.06854391367096288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08161170443177057,0.0,0.10519994737690827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10905676046761778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09500172453914772,0.08484482018012965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06431064899227504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10271228544348104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09521170044071696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10424571938830653,0.0,0.20330870563754075,0.1406232554599675,0.19232639814170926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10473650312727424,0.08156994394045136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09727428700080673,0.1927815088210452,0.0,0.0,0.09665560263905336,0.0,0.10178365084364233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10197552110219296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09266534215028842,0.20407953363467532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07297133324950933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18318281971892825,0.0,0.0,0.10024325437885216,0.1053200067410709,0.0,0.0,0.2756695281994068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09645233191940204,0.0,0.0,0.09597206530141694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07630019044918485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15873521232777893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06791114406579908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10887849831569116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0771178415489127,0.0,0.08833427896551795,0.0,0.11140081821771636,0.0,0.06147838733827182,0.0,0.0,0.11189388605364753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06514110445984643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3314665019908473,0.0,0.07916558155077094,0.0,0.07615754898998944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10404945366530816,0.06984990418513716,0.0,0.0,0.13631471453642194,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,on_my_way_to_hell,2018/01/23,"Help needed with sleeping pill addiction I posted this on another subreddit but this seems more active.

This is my first time posting here and my first time talking about this to anyone. I try to put this as short as possible, but there's a lot of things I need to mention. I was sexually abused as a child by a relative, and my mother had depression and she became an alcoholic when I was bout 7. There was just the two of us, I have no siblings and my father was in the picture, but he was quite distant to me. He also did some sexually inappropriate things to me since I was 4 or something. On top of all of that, I had childhood rheumatism since I was 2 but it went away by the time I was 9. So, my childhood was never really ""normal childhood"". When I went to school, I was bullied by different people at different times and even sexually harassed by older boys at school when I was 14. I got depressed and didn't go to school, so I went to live with a foster family for a little while. I was 15 then, and started to smoke (topaccos) and drink. I was raped when I was 15 by this older guy and sexually taken advantage by other older guys.


At one point, I found a boyfriend with whom (and my mother) we moved to another, much bigger city. I started high school there and got all A's. I loved studying. When I turned 18 me and my boyfriend split up and just some months after that I found another guy, who was 35 years old and we started dating and soon I moved to his apartment. I finished high school and after that I got severely depressed again and started to go to a psychiatrist. Years went on, I wasn't in school. I tried to kill myself with my antidepressants several times. My partner was always there for me and my mother, who didn't drink nearly as much and she had gotten her life together, was also. I started to drink way too much, and then at some point I decided to go to a kind of rehab. I stopped drinking and found the joy of life again (for a little while). I applied to university and got to in to study my dream subject. I was sober for years and my studies went almost too well. However, I still wasn't healthy enough to study full time so luckily I got to study as slow as I wanted.I had been diagnosed as having severe depression, dependent personality, and later, after I tried suicide again about 8 years ago, my doctor diagnosed also anxiety disorder and ptsd and prescribed me benzos for my anxiety. I started using benzos everyday, at evenings to take the stress and anxieties away and I'm still using them, even though managed to decrease the amount by 1/3. I was also in therapy for five years. But I'm not writing about the benzos.


My biggest problem now is sleeping med called Zopiclone (brand names Zimovane and Imovane). I started using them also around 2010, and I also used Zolpidem a little. I got these amazing highs from these meds. It felt like my life has a purpose. That my depression, that has been with me for so long that I can remember, was vanished. Everything was so good, and I was good. Now, I still get Zopiclone (Imovane) every 30 days (I'm supposed to use it 1 per night). I still study, in fact I got my BA last year, which was huge for me. And I got an A from my thesis. My studies are going super well, I get good grades mostly but I'm still able to study on my own pace, so I study kinda slow (I try to get better all the time though, it doesn't always go as planned). I have also been cutting myself since I was a teen, but not for a long time expect last autumn I did it again. I am in therapy at the moment with another therapist.


Back to Zopiclone. Nowadays when the day comes I can buy it, I'm like child on Christmas. For the past year maybe, I've been taking 4 to even 10 pills in the evening, several hours before going to bed. They do not give me the same feeling as in the beginning, but still they do give me the sweet high, when I'm not anxious or depressed about anything. This way, the 30 pills last only a few days, and after that I get a bit more depressed than usual, because I have to wait for another month for the sweet feeling. I'm also very obese, and benzos seem to make me want to eat a lot, but the sleeping pills makes me not want to eat. Lately, I've been going to deep net in my weakest moments to see, if people sell these pills of mine there, like just before I came to write this. Yes, people sell these but the prices are way out of what I could pay. I feel bad, because I should try to get better in therapy for example, but there's no way I can tell her about this. I'm afraid I wouldn't get these pills after that. I feel like I'm trying to balance myself between the public me everyone thinks I am and between this drug addict, who might do something I'll be regretting forever. I keep fantazising, how my sleeping pills would be given to me as anxiety reliever, because that's what they do to me (even the next morning/day they seem to be working). I have never even tried cannabis/hash/whatever, even though I was offered more than once. Also, I do drink nowadays, but once a week only but too much at once though. Could anyone offer some...I don't know, help? Peer support? What on earth should I do? Sorry for the long post. I've been thinking of writing this for months. Also, English is not my native language, so sorry for any errors. Edit: Sorry, can't get bigger spaces between the paragraphs. Edit 2: I'm 35 years at the moment in case someone wonders

TL;DR Lots of trauma and shit in childhood, severe depression, self harm and suicide attempts, but been getting better little by little, until I got hooked on Zopiclone, which I now misuse. Almost want to buy more illegally. Need help.

addiction,rkman94,2018/01/23,"Looking for guidance 
I'm posting this here because I don't have anyone to talk to and my life is spiralling out of control. Im 23 years old and ever since I started working at a bar where I can drink on the job, which was about 3 years ago I've ran up a $7000+ tab which is just a running joke to my friends. I joke about it but deep inside this is slowly killing me.

I've already got hypothyroidism and kidney disease, which I don't take care of. I barely take the medication prescribed for me. I've got no motivation besides sitting in bed drinking and basically doing any drug I can get my hands on.

I've moved out of my parents 2 and a half years ago, I support myself by paying for a car and rent however I'm so far in debt that I can barely afford to pay these basic necessities. I spend all my money on either booze or drugs. I tell myself no im not drinking today but when I get to work or have a day off I seem to end up getting myself piss drunk.

I dropped out of high school my last semester and still haven't gotten myself to college, I have all these dreams and aspirations buried so far deep I don't even know what I want in life anymore. Im not suicidal at all however I feel this drug and alcohol abuse is slowly killing me with my underlying conditions, and I can't control it.

In 3 months time I have to find a new place to live because my roommates are all going seperate ways when our rental contract is up. These 3 roommates are my only friends and once this is over I don't know what to do with myself. I have no other friends and it seems my only choice is to move back to my parents.

I'm hiding all this behind a fake smile, I don't know who to talk to or what to do anymore with my life I have absolutely no motivation. I'm posting here in hopes of finding some sort of guidance on steps to get help. I'm sorry if this is the wrong spot to post this but I really don't know what to do or who to talk to about this.",3.621198995605777,3.9904697675544822,5.032698412698412,86.22499775804863,71.6634382566586,7.668155322392613,28.129226078378625,7.526774132740827,1.4283518787552687,1526,53,337,16,27,513,189,413,0.134,0.763,0.103,-0.9433,9,0,7,0,1,1,25.0,1,0,0,6,15,13,3,0,11,0,32,17,3,4,6,53,61,24,3,3,12,2,2,0,3,0,8,0,2,0,25,18,7,2,11,8,6,7,14,5,0,1,5,3,46,8,57,56,7,59,0,0,1,0,13,27,1,10,19,217,71,9,0.0,0.0987002928703878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1476859566040011,0.08902544637246858,0.0,0.0,0.09192680126794732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05664881604394381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16522814872739974,0.05824731168099748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0640547739459819,0.0,0.10156132682923588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08493283960486424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18686253013319198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05372346713607932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2448153305959804,0.28981468711393377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07378162746427434,0.0,0.0,0.05502076762764768,0.07535222555846463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04212043989244554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15227464918888806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19307879897371366,0.0,0.17408926967908794,0.0,0.047342947310900614,0.0,0.13324984850638344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055836165565822944,0.08801406802243347,0.0,0.08273855755883851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2699442208199002,0.0,0.08266525611100574,0.0,0.1843245922131221,0.0,0.1831243406054188,0.0679029667656263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1765178664316462,0.0,0.0,0.07355797060431182,0.0,0.06995344015050235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08391888927239477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06649156531193591,0.1770755596202137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08045444211173555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08741236115290736,0.08871485015825037,0.0,0.12671119040853912,0.0,0.0,0.18499598350033264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08703378112428671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2393434004972224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05336595902481813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08430696347567086,0.0,0.1516716294846302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06890900446148944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09325075580830083,0.05896220833159205,0.0,0.06652578882713044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09111983183088578,0.09453112281985143,0.0,0.0,0.12526679953560993,0.20086710224248647,0.07281039021379081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04857458014647982,0.0,0.0789613913764306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04913419785219812,0.06612194995891135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12129097982844712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09107862388946072,0.0,0.16093297361311007
addiction,pimptywin,2018/01/23,"website blocker help Hello peeps,

I'm having a hard time with a misc addiction I have related to porn. I'm trying to find a website blocker but I can always seem to uninstall or somehow bypass it since I'm pretty proficient in computers. I was wondering if anyone else has any ideas on how to block a website where I have 0 way to get rid of it when my addiction acts up? at least until I can get some sobriety in this area.

addiction,ZenStudentThrowaway,2018/01/23,"I Made a Big Mistake While Trying to Cope with Depression, and Now I'm Getting Thrown Out of School I've been dealing with generalized anxiety &amp; depression for about 7 years now-- probably more-- the feelings go back almost as far as I can remember. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and a few different therapists for about 4 years. Medication like SSRI's only cause my depression to manifest itself into a dull, constant boredom instead of a deep constant sadness; and therapy has only provided some moderate help with my underlying issues.

This has always been an issue for me, but I've always found ways to move forward. Even when my hobbies lose everything about them that makes them enjoyable, even when I can't get out of bed in the morning, even when I feel soul-crushingly lonely, I've always been able to get myself through the day hoping tomorrow would be better.

I feel like it might be important to note that I'm an experienced meditator as well, I've been meditating for 25 minutes a day for several years. Meditation has helped me much more than anything else I've tried for depression and anxiety, but perhaps I'm digressing from the point of this post.

Anyway,

Ever since my depression started in high school, I've looked to self-medication for relief. I started smoking weed because I didn't like how I felt so bored all the time, and slowly started smoking every day. I moved to xanax, then opiates, and ended up struggling with roxycontin for about 6 months. My friends were not positive influences on me at all, and many of my closest friends in high school eventually went on to use heroin and go into lengthy rehab programs. Being able to see my friends struggle with heroin was what made me finally kick opiates, I saw their lives falling apart and I never wanted it to happen to me.

After I kicked roxy, I still found that I was trying to fill some hole that was inside of me. I moved on to other drugs instead of opiates (particularly LSD) and although I was proud of myself for getting off the ""hard stuff"", taking hallucinogens on the reg was still not good for me. I was able to cut down my LSD usage, and that's when I discovered the beauty of microdosing.

I would take 40ug's before class every few days, It improved my mood to a significant degree that I never thought to be possible. I was attending classes, doing my work, making meaningful relationships. After I had some time to accept my problems and work on improving myself, I finally was able to get off of antidepressants. They were horrible-- the withdrawals, the numbness, the sexual indifference-- I just wanted to leave that all behind me and work on myself through meditation and therapy. After a couple weeks of being off of depression meds, I was able to stop taking LSD so frequently. It was a major crutch for me, and although it DID help my situation, I decided it was best to leave the trips for special occasions and move on with my problems naturally.

I would order tabs online and save them for a special time, and trip maybe once a month or less. I was feeling even better, and eventually was able to quit smoking weed.

After being completely sober for 4 days in a row for the first time in over year, I was feeling amazing. My motivation was high, and I was optimistic about the future. But that's when It all started falling to shit.

I had ordered tabs about a month and a half before the ""incident"", and after noticing that they had gotten taken by customs, I realized that ordering this shit offline was seriously risky and not worth it at all. Without my knowledge, a reshippment was issued to my billing address at my university, so when I found it in my mailbox i was pretty surprised. I took it into my apartment and put it somewhere safe, and did not use any nor was planning on using it anytime soon (granted, I did not want to throw them out because, to me, the tabs represented a lot of money that I didn't feel right about getting rid of just yet).

After the aforementioned 4 days of sobriety (with the tabs j chillin' in my apartment) I received a call from my school's campus security asking me to come in to talk about a crime I was a potential witness to. I couldn't get out of the meeting, so before work, I took the bus to campus to see the officer who called me. After he met me at the door, he led me into a room with two federal agents waiting for me.

They had the package that was seized, and long story short, I was not under arrest, but they needed my cooperation in taking down the lab that I bought from. I worked with them and called my attorney, but when they asked me if I had gotten a reshipment I hesitated and they then assumed that I had substances in my apartment. and after being threatened with a federal search warrant, I signed a consent to search form because I didn't want my housemate to get involved in this and hate me forever.

Campus security along with the Fed's escorted me to my apartment and had me place my package into an evidence bag. I was still not under arrest, but now the university was aware of my situation.

As of now, I'm awaiting a hearing with my school, and I'm facing a year-long suspension along with several other repercussions. I'm so afraid that my education is going to be jeopardized, I had aspirations of attending Law School, but with this on my record, I'm finding it very hard to believe that I'd get into a valid program. On top of that, I'm about to lose my support network of friends who have empowered me to quit using drugs and have shown me how to enjoy life only to go home to a town where I have nothing and nobody. I'm terrified of falling back into a rut where I use substances to relieve my pain, and it's so unfortunate that something like this happened just as I was beginning to fully sober up for the first time in a significantly long while.

I'm at a total loss right now, I have no idea what to do and I'm finding it impossible to get my mind off the situation. If anybody has any advice, stories, comments, questions, etc. please post them, this is one of the most difficult times ive ever had to get through. Thanks.

TL;DR-- Microdosing LSD has helped me immensely with my depression, but now my uni knows that I bought it online, and is trying to hit me with a year-long suspension and drug rehabilitation program. Nobody got hurt, nobody else was involved, but I need help moving forward with my mental and educational situations.",8.687145061942964,7.468324343724365,8.894867980144884,68.09031882204089,61.51025430680886,11.841108994591286,38.79063138721653,10.893934059147801,4.2522537812321834,5121,221,898,109,59,1697,474,1219,0.127,0.75,0.123,0.2987,2,2,4,0,1,0,140.0,0,0,13,19,52,60,4,3,63,0,79,13,3,15,10,170,169,78,0,16,23,0,9,4,4,4,9,1,6,0,50,70,1,5,24,1,5,27,17,29,1,5,68,16,135,30,188,87,21,179,0,14,5,0,42,74,2,13,80,650,185,21,0.24077519827834715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039213789521695984,0.0,0.0,0.04018359686173871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1001721265332842,0.04347997112329564,0.0,0.054578463787545314,0.0,0.061397455884079015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033022912134436984,0.0,0.07503076937588063,0.0,0.0,0.0617137551033412,0.0,0.07338716303794357,0.0,0.10244097990178422,0.045211866192330974,0.04211311932397742,0.07098203216275037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12292919886160028,0.0,0.0,0.04122374220211522,0.0,0.03456775227062288,0.04207470240916667,0.0867308174608783,0.0,0.0,0.04440219621292135,0.0,0.1552800840543615,0.041371442836916315,0.2419425463767506,0.0,0.0,0.0419264726353699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1396113944683018,0.0,0.06704559418764236,0.0,0.035542559968255165,0.0,0.04475466535494069,0.10601983177191404,0.07259831716100405,0.06762116303288587,0.0,0.03606553715636164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1217431747347746,0.02866830829320177,0.038530324823408624,0.0879191535717385,0.07335472307196958,0.06826775355183166,0.0,0.13199878861487144,0.12401488061409845,0.0,0.2306243563627776,0.0,0.09122539589880428,0.033658468802328215,0.03209498688269161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07097223755507963,0.0,0.07189576152958196,0.039619276742767086,0.0,0.0,0.045228524578015517,0.0,0.1344887834021841,0.12719610822838595,0.04025285924714697,0.03985734992286365,0.0,0.0,0.042959138264678114,0.04530098193306538,0.0,0.1256533758211011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022053958693059626,0.0,0.0,0.08498205659421125,0.0,0.0,0.028344440518759725,0.07842039990250987,0.0,0.03543481854765043,0.14205231581513947,0.03369842096176147,0.08978861965431895,0.0,0.03411641056227998,0.0,0.07594243810390464,0.053573104833617415,0.040684709982089666,0.04031517484280732,0.0,0.08914898880141156,0.04042594690497577,0.040440794822259964,0.04257073933070845,0.040519052161261164,0.0,0.09609223306819667,0.21325494276204654,0.029499579113995162,0.05951058622397828,0.06190022541080094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03850504941518028,0.045687359847861216,0.0,0.042736288019008084,0.027192584277419482,0.0915601940183252,0.04270029781364285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0419264726353699,0.04404981071243075,0.03793506463246965,0.04523964315341968,0.07686536117949543,0.04082582281589345,0.043266064517843074,0.07679644911719193,0.0,0.040340929470956466,0.04495388767741845,0.08536468699133279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04308374255807069,0.045458560554929424,0.06854023458545863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24367735503203294,0.09593332987891716,0.0,0.04186350715397895,0.090669146706366,0.08238409366671724,0.03319528868634911,0.18042760730014065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03089341847442665,0.0,0.0,0.11361461640303902,0.0,0.09614169218354547,0.03354980782673297,0.0,0.08390350504693675,0.045938332844536536,0.0,0.04553814028184651,0.0,0.0,0.12068865617478156,0.032254330662287334,0.0,0.036945575567768466,0.09178247433263012,0.04659309382465784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03185810209706238,0.14039795437895786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0891700348519059,0.10898036982126144,0.0,0.03920039711888155,0.0,0.0,0.17329372075175853,0.0,0.03311079243304938,0.09467696680989936,0.03185269087172863,0.0321892234538026,0.0,0.03608096986518244,0.037200170171252704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03868311650955656,0.0,0.14607267663784002,0.0,0.0,0.08551989633950763,0.0,0.0,0.1550513335662932
addiction,SAVE_AMERICA,2018/01/23,"My Poem 
I’m 21 days clean 
And I am only eighteen 
Until now I thought “I should be dead”
I was thirteen 
And thought “I hate nicotine”
Now it’s the only thing that keeps me looking ahead 
I was seventeen 
a job or weed was what I was between 
I turned into a pot head

addiction,fatalfright21,2018/01/24,"Length of kratom withdrawals So let me give some background info. Im 19 y/o, 6'2 140 lbs. I was doing heroin for a while knowing I had a problem I couldn't stop. Finally got on Suboxone, then after a while it stopped working (I think) so I quit Suboxone and went to kratom. Mainly for the fact that I'd rather go through intense short withdrawals then protracted Suboxone withdrawals. Ive been taking 2 grams 3-4 times a day. My main question is how long does kratom withdrawal last (approximately) and how would one compare it to Suboxone or opiate withdrawals? Thanks to anyone who can help.

addiction,byronwindstrom,2018/01/24,"Help with addiction to kratom and klonopin Unlike a lot of people I am not addicted to drugs that I buy illegally but the drugs I use medically. Kratom has taken over my life and I take it 4 times a day, it’s not severe but I can’t even cut down my use and I take it more to get high than for pain. I’ve been prescribed klonopin for years and I’ve become very dependent sometimes even exceeding my daily dose. I don’t want to be addicted to these things but it’s like impossible for me to even do a taper, I feel like I don’t have the willpower to reduce my dose, which is unfortunately my only choice because I actually need these medications for pain and panic attacks/ptsd/severe anxiety. Obviously my tolerance has gotten quite high. I’m not looking to completely quit but does anyone have any suggestions on how to really do a taper and stick to it? I tried quitting kratom and got through 5 days no withdrawal or anything but severe pain but as soon as I had access to it again I started taking it again and was soon back to a high dose.

addiction,nikolkaa,2018/01/25,"Boyfriend found out I relapsed, which I hid, now he's playing mind games I had a hard time describing my issue in the title..

My boyfriend of 2 years knows that I am on methadone and have a history of opiate abuse. Mostly stems from depression and anxiety and just getting in the wrong crowd at the wrong time.

I was clean for a while before I met him and for about a year and a half after meeting I was as well. About half a year ago I started going through a really horrible time mentally. I used heroin 5 to 7 times over that period whenever I was crazy sad and angry. I stopped and haven't used in the past 2 months. A couple of weeks ago I let my boyfriend use my phone and he came across some messages from my dealer at the time.

He got really upset, we didn't talk for a week. It seemed like he hated me for it. And then a week later suddenly he wants to come over and acts super duper nice and sweet. Tells me him being nice doesn't mean he's forgiven me. I understand that and take it for what it is. I told him I will do urine drug tests for him and signed up to see an addiction psychotherapist to hopefully fix what's been broken. All is good, then after a few days he sends me texts saying he doesn't trust me and dissapears again..ignores every attempt I make at talking to him. I know for a fact once the weekend comes around he will suddenly want to see me again and be nice. (He does this when he's mad at me..ghosts me then comes back around)

I don't know what to say to him. I told him I can't stand these mind games. I understand he's angry but I don't think it's fair for him to keep me thinking he's feeling one way and then keeps turning it around. It fucks with my emotions because I'm happy he's talking to me and then super sad, and then happy, then sad. It's not a healthy cycle. I texted him saying that but still nothing.

I don't know..should I just let this run its course? I honestly don't think this is a healthy way of dealing with the situation though. It's really hard on me. I wish he would either tell me he doesn't want me in his life or decide he does and work through it with me. This back and forth bullshit just fucks with me emotionally. 

Tldr; Boyfriend found out I relapsed because my depression was really bad. Got angry and ignored me for a week. Then suddenly appeared again and was super nice and sweet. Now he's angry again and ignoring me completely. He will for sure start being nice again because he's done it before. I can't stand the back and forth emotional rollercoaster. I'm happy he's in my life, then sad, then happy, then sad. It's too hard on me and don't know what to do or say.",2.31794509679467,3.925978281021898,3.526159949222471,91.00019517613458,76.4087591240876,6.954998413202159,22.67946683592511,7.7425588080867325,0.839616344017772,2070,59,458,30,46,672,225,548,0.18,0.685,0.135,-0.9703,0,0,2,0,1,0,54.0,1,0,0,5,22,39,4,1,24,0,36,7,1,4,3,88,84,45,0,6,9,0,4,1,0,4,4,4,1,0,27,40,0,5,15,4,0,9,13,17,1,3,17,12,65,22,59,58,5,85,0,7,2,2,52,21,2,7,52,279,92,2,0.0,0.08018578334954128,0.0,0.07377755604422087,0.0,0.0,0.11998256312744066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051772464709145725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1807397446792612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15611753755020535,0.05650718975401425,0.12376520342014655,0.0,0.11517571730765505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07740407731969676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17489236732065233,0.07095769732671442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0748829443611568,0.0,0.043645851205496335,0.06977167159123628,0.116579627548465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11844861401179912,0.06925672676767244,0.0,0.0,0.0784834473353597,0.0,0.0,0.2283814226811564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05702051048045618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03421935608882396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14840794354988945,0.0,0.12513197548722207,0.035358265046636334,0.0,0.03846220923767465,0.05676397704564463,0.10825442532093753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2881722801490677,0.18187500066233114,0.06681669712307023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06721820025173454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07063685697949681,0.0,0.12030826165659422,0.0,0.0,0.18596663032571426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1384079536640976,0.09560406211153748,0.03306340081985866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04517470047284235,0.0,0.0,0.07371973002110394,0.0,0.0,0.06820216221005274,0.0,0.13666828163222974,0.0,0.0540188696063574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06493758685164898,0.0,0.0,0.07207344120060595,0.045859460773462916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06460503604330614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17342162233394595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2152768064884792,0.0,0.0,0.1078590823038753,0.0616102955140029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07607140879858834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09580378589749934,0.0,0.0540466733675727,0.05658072363739632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06378445734922161,0.0,0.050884430817461294,0.1631878231974175,0.11830477915492026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1300934258780704,0.06649198132043256,0.0,0.19731404267641944,0.0,0.0,0.1293359103105855,0.0,0.0,0.07361277941581408,0.0,0.14090759335104686,0.0,0.1753527323778925,0.0,0.0,0.11975235420639455,0.10743717571369436,0.21714455900886215,0.0,0.060849450913528814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07782482664364823,0.0,0.0,0.049269419309369615,0.0,0.0,0.04807556221359192,0.14798762173006216,0.0,0.13074466326948378
addiction,123undeuxtrois123,2018/01/26,"I am addicted to Coke [16] Normally I don’t buy it for home nor drink it at restaurants (I want to taste the food) but I was on vacation and there was free soda and I drinked it and justified it as holiday prize. 

Today I drank a liter of coke because they gave it with my pizza (I eat fast-food on occasion). I regretted while gulping each oZ of it but couldn’t stop drinking it. 

I have smoked with my friends (tobacco not weed) but didn’t get addicted (The last time I smoke was summer). 

This shit is underrated for being addictive. How can I quit this?

Note: I am not addicted to caffeine because I already drink 3-4 cups of coffee everyday.

addiction,jb001ok,2018/01/26,"Addicted to electronics and entertainment. Playing PS4 and watching tv is literally all I want to do, and it’s interrupting my life a lot I’m 16, and my sleep schedule is completely ruined. And I feel tired all the time because of how late I’ve been sleeping recently. 
I usually stay up until about 1-3am every night watching Netflix or playing PS4. It’s making me tired as shit, but every night I just go back to doing it, and I can’t help it.
Also, I’m always late for stuff because every spare moment I get, I’m playing video games or watching something on my phone. 
It’s sort of controlling my life at the moment, but because I have nothing else to do, it seems impossible to stop.

addiction,holyshitnuggets,2018/01/28,"Am I an alcoholic? When I first started drinking in college, I liked to think that I could handle it pretty well. However, as drinking became more and more common within my friend group and I turned 21, I feel like problems have arisen.

I have never, ever felt addicted to alcohol. I can easily go a week without drinking, nor do I feel an urge to drink everyday. In fact, I usually only drink on the weekends socially. However, I can never seem to accurately judge my tolerance. I have nights where I can have 5 drinks and overall be okay, and other nights where I have 5 drinks and end up blacking out.

I feel as though I black out easily and it terrifies me. I have had probably more than 10 instances where I got way too drunk and ended up not remembering anything. I've blacked out and had no memory of how I got home, what I said, or what I did. Every time I black out, I feel extremely embarrassed and worried/guilty that I may have said or done something bad. I've gotten violent while blackout and had no memory of it. I've been sexually assaulted while blackout drunk and falling asleep. Now, last night, I yet again blacked out. I lost my phone and woke up on the couch with vomit around me. My friend showed me a video of myself from last night where I was blackout drunk singing in a cab. I have no memory of it, and seeing myself on video like that freaked me out so much. I looked so out of it. So lost and so drunk. I cried because of how disturbed I was at how out of it I looked on the video.

When I drink at home, I'm usually able to stop at 2 or 3 drinks and just enjoy a nice buzz. But when I go out is when issues seem to arise and I never know how much I can tolerate. I might think I'm doing fine, but then I overdo it and end up blacking out. I'm so tired of this and I feel terrified that one day something really bad could happen. But I so enjoy those nights where I don't overdo it and just enjoy a nice buzz. I don't know what to do, what to label myself, or how to go from here.

I could never tell my family I blacked out and lost my phone, they would definitely think I'm an alcoholic because they don't really drink. I'm going to have to lie to them and tell them it was stolen. I'm so ashamed. My friends don't think I have a problem and just tell me to drink less, but I really am scared of how often I wake up with no memory of the previous night. Please help me.",2.828915470494419,4.081227262626263,4.3177379053694835,87.3078349282297,74.35353535353536,7.958001063264222,24.137426900584803,8.532816995589336,1.3911414141414138,1865,55,406,34,38,622,200,495,0.141,0.7490000000000001,0.11,-0.9256,3,0,16,0,0,0,53.0,0,0,4,4,35,28,2,4,13,1,40,23,2,6,6,86,79,54,0,6,13,0,6,3,3,3,6,2,3,0,20,36,18,1,15,21,0,5,15,14,1,2,19,18,67,14,59,53,6,76,0,3,10,0,17,33,0,9,40,284,87,1,0.0581085361831511,0.0,0.0,0.06334688158171943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18630105973645825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04781837411057428,0.05172891692809156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09703640103550658,0.0708448486266312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13918481342286884,0.0,0.06382949843054045,0.03747519863887516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05946520736820884,0.0,0.6261666763958961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15440074659289496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05256249775414008,0.04895894793491995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05477955638619098,0.0,0.14690710930178744,0.041512749859877685,0.055793307371167535,0.0,0.0,0.049427091192628864,0.0,0.0,0.13468353273193856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13209768089850646,0.0,0.09294940940293836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05138518664037274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03894892692819308,0.0,0.11657519934428286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06065021470354792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06386986363350643,0.0947324252645579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08516668681065266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09759307077008046,0.0,0.19029699455413748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06164397407449487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08543292029696427,0.0,0.17926754152828575,0.0,0.0,0.3271855489661529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03937584797843978,0.044194160238211294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06378572306318221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05911727169411544,0.06265083015646457,0.11120404279609353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1116774486991021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06582564391336566,0.0,0.1105490492621383,0.0,0.058176781835432415,0.0,0.0463049800004301,0.10579965787429997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05923433485820776,0.0,0.08946958016002042,0.0,0.0,0.04112952099342871,0.0,0.0,0.048581338177125684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1523682655844474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14893441466523707,0.057091341766793036,0.0,0.033883554744864874,0.06678721423153924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06320540108105246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12799668618717025,0.0,0.0,0.04612385129246152,0.04661116267325368,0.0,0.05224655258330283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05601455527260832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04127863688915929,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,ConnectBus,2018/01/28,"Adderall addiction I was introduced to adderall in 2012 and shortly after I was hooked. I’m a musician and I used it to practice. It only took a few months before I was taking it just to sit around and  feel good. I’m 6’4 and around 220, and at my worst I was taking 120mg+ a day. My prescription (2x30mg a day)would last about 2 weeks and Im sure I was in withdrawal until my next script was ready to fill. This went on for 3 years until I got dropped from my parents insurance (turned 26). Because of this addiction, I started to resent my music making. The adderall would help me practice but I ended up being so stressed about trying to be perfect (something that is impossible for musicians). Since I was dropped from my parents insurance, I’ve been doing pretty well with adderall. I’ve got some friends who have prescriptions and I’ll ask them for one or two so I can practice for a concert or what not. My problem is that once it’s in my system, I just want more and more and I won’t stop until I’ve got more. Honestly I’m surprised I haven’t had a heart attack because of it. I used to be really successful and I had a promising future. I’ve had a bit of a relapse recently. I couldn’t control myself. It was 1, and then 2, and then before I knew it, 6. What the fuck is wrong with me? I never thought I would be an addict and yet, here I am. I want my life back under my control. It is nothing but a double edged sword. I want to be successful, and yet I feel like I need adderall to get anything done. Has anyone else felt this way? If so, please let me know what you’ve done to escape this awful drug.

addiction,quagswagging2,2018/01/29,"Need help learning how to help friend who is out of control Hey Reddit, I'm here to see if anyone would have any pointers on how to help a friend of mine who is spiraling out of control..if this is the wrong subreddit to post on I apologize.

Here is a rundown of his situation:

- He's on probation for possession of Marijuana
- He has a child on the way and is currently not in a relationship with the mother 
- He's an alcoholic (I think, although I guess it could be worse)
- He can't seem to ever go 24 hours without some type of drug use
- He has a decent job and a place to live (family) but he intends to move out because they keep fighting 

Yesterday I took him to the ER because he was unresponsive (took a bunch of Xanax and drank excessively), he was fine and got discharged about 10 hours later. Today he begged me to take him to get alcohol to which I refused and he started calling rehab centers (not even sure if he's serious but I hope he is) but they refused to admit him because he doesn't live in the same county they are located. He plans on moving out today but he has nowhere to go, he refuses to stay with me and thinks he's going to be okay sleeping on the streets in 20 degree weather. 

My questions are what can I do as his friend to help? I'm not familiar with what options he has besides rehab or just going to jail. He doesn't have any type of insurance so I'm not even sure if he could go to rehab. We're from Michigan if that helps anyone...if any other information would be helpful just let me know and I appreciate anything that would give me an idea of what I can do to prevent my friend from completely destroying his life or killing himself.",4.9141575091575085,5.201892695266274,6.048089602704987,80.36815581854044,68.79289940828403,9.278331924485773,32.07156945618484,9.23628265651192,2.6791119752042842,1313,54,267,24,21,440,171,338,0.066,0.7909999999999999,0.14300000000000002,0.9706,2,0,3,0,2,0,31.0,0,0,3,2,11,14,3,0,15,1,32,10,1,5,3,64,59,22,1,11,17,1,0,0,4,3,8,0,0,1,11,14,3,6,9,0,0,9,8,5,1,0,6,1,26,9,50,44,3,37,0,0,1,0,56,16,0,12,9,169,37,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19765684733557945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18865998724161145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0646611753254812,0.0,0.07609964015862036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16911702628508138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09442805205742603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09695903559576276,0.0,0.20743877226263824,0.14766867916410115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10724247897771608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12215868507711912,0.08364958531795451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08717788102536393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2857860551676043,0.0,0.04831474820097532,0.08871113948170489,0.2627804209454924,0.0,0.07396128308506959,0.0,0.1018724341165752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3719071648416148,0.0,0.0,0.09184925831066024,0.18213991765360046,0.0,0.0,0.10439383449600224,0.0,0.0,0.09176788532308126,0.08219667114278233,0.10231068550566977,0.0,0.0508222386257919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09456269165742463,0.06531833761946354,0.0,0.0,0.16331551436677558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1965741160582308,0.0,0.06856957646310423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09661744753712016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08856617948485056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10359397324063127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09928431787022096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07369117794420392,0.08418642460031857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10394658664811654,0.0925425073405612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06545479234109321,0.09856681587700973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17431454806387112,0.0,0.06953023455910395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11850941791800686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17531234401676282,0.0,0.20548786059619786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07986933276671851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07340292411384718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08914329646661946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09424066162885386,0.197076299974536,0.10110768544947768,0.0,0.0

addiction,Gaia_Nicolosi,2018/01/30,"Hi, I'm Gaia Kymicsu (22F) of the band ""SuFai Tonno Inseparabile Findus Marina Blu"". I was addicted to a specific premade sim. I think I might still be addicted to it, but less. I always get thoughts about her but know I can't install any of the sims games. I don't really want to draw or fic her either, I just have wacky fantasies about them. I was so addicted to them that I vandalized its sims wiki page. What do?
this is the premade sim i was addicted to: http://sims.wikia.com/wiki/Susan_Wainwright

addiction,throwaway8275739,2018/01/31,"100% of the outcomes in my life is my decisions I don’t feel sad, most the time I don’t feel anything at all but I have daily thoughts of deep loathing and anxiety. Like things I need to do and get done and hating myself for not getting them done and not doing this and that and then the cycle repeats. I’ve been this way the past year. I hate it bc I was doing awesome building my life up and being healthy until I was using cocaine and alcohol weekly. When I started, I wasn’t using that often, maybe once a month, I used to network at events and drink there.  Its now gotten out of control and every time I drink even one drink, I crave cocaine.

I want to do things but find myself hiding in my house all day, unable to even go to work most the time. It’s ruining my life and I’m sick of it. I need help but I don’t know how to change. The guilt of how my self control has worsened and the lies I’ve told everyone just makes me feel like a piece of shit and really I’m a loser who doesn’t deserve success or happiness. 

I plan to take a few sleeping pills tonight and crash early so I can head to the gym. I’m planning on changing my friends and avoiding people who drink. I really need some help and I’m very unhappy with myself, I hope I can change. It’s going to be a lot of work but one step at a time.

I caused my own depression by my choices.",1.5909407665505242,3.1950186585365863,3.236328919860629,92.30684181184671,78.44250871080139,5.985728222996516,22.978257839721252,6.742157984588678,0.5324699372822304,1053,33,235,10,25,349,153,287,0.198,0.6729999999999999,0.13,-0.9725,0,1,7,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,1,8,10,15,3,2,14,0,21,13,3,9,2,55,49,27,0,5,8,0,3,2,1,0,6,0,0,1,13,18,5,3,7,5,0,3,7,9,0,2,9,3,35,6,28,38,9,31,0,4,0,0,8,9,1,7,20,156,48,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10505536075192644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0752010603637919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08089449222452069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1009836346188586,0.3119726870420728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22050898157845286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06339691010603553,0.0,0.08466770567822511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20119495254914302,0.0,0.3851956778852928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12985560482981184,0.0,0.08282400451098339,0.09393214764946434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14911392826104852,0.07022724806562891,0.0,0.0,0.08984660485150281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0759481837543663,0.0,0.10271788446113277,0.0,0.11173502883652424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10464472358234754,0.0,0.1941065198224408,0.10088661382809924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13178004167437388,0.0,0.0,0.09763645526775903,0.0,0.11342776135636085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05402442348974956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20830165860164448,0.09605116599547206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08357317785068706,0.0,0.0,0.0656176095972946,0.0,0.0987579649116028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0784640309645887,0.0,0.0,0.2186699329381096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10468883860952284,0.13322448901170106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09384075574905698,0.06815050077886879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12595005822871305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1025508331964211,0.0,0.10090599213987322,0.0,0.0,0.09837338422224673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0695789386002029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07391116445737088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1306154816668613,0.0,0.0,0.07804111829650842,0.2292836598341361,0.0,0.0,0.09393214764946434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2547051118116128,0.0,0.08110976797318419,0.057981297381234025,0.07802786270221364,0.07885224888090837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14313062344580094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0633035170980584

addiction,bharamaty,2018/01/31,"My good friend had a great story of addiction, and overcoming it. I think some of you may find something to connect with. Ok, so I will pre-face this it is an episode released on my podcast,
It is not meant as a promotion, I've just gotten a lot of good response through addicts that it was an inspiring story and hopefully relevant to whomever ever would like to listen.

addiction,LauraIngallsSister,2018/02/02,"my sister passed last month. Toxicology just came back... dolopin(sp?) and fentanyl. did she die peacefully? sorry if this doesnt belong here... please suggest where it can go. we talked everyday on the phone.. she was in full time post secondary and had a full time job. she seemed totally fine. i guess i didnt know her as well as i thought. i only knew she smoked weed.

if there is anyone here who has done these drugs that can tell me how they make you feel? or what an overdose would feel like? I'm just wondering how she would have felt in her last moments..... regardless of good or bad. thanks in advance.

addiction,Piikiita,2018/02/03,"I have an incredibly bratty and stupid addiction that I've had since I was 10. Which is stealing gum... But I have a legitimate stealing problem. Specifically, I can't stop taking gum from my mom's purse without her permission. I'm not sure why I do this nor why I only steal HER gum but I know it's a problem. It's almost like an impulse where as soon as I know she has gum, I'll wake up literally at 3 a.m. when everyone is asleep and I'll sneak into whichever room her purse is, and take gum. It's even worse because I have no self-control when it comes to gum, and I might even be addicted. I find it difficult not to spend money on buying a gum pack every chance I get. The problem is that I down 60-piece packs of gum in literally a few hours. I'll be chewing 20 pieces of gum so big that my jaw hurts and I rarely throw them away until they've melted in my mouth or I can replace them with a new piece of gum. Anyways, back to stealing. I won't stop for whatever reason... Every time I stop, I end up doing it again in a few weeks. I couldn't even have been smart enough about it that I take only 3 pieces so she doesn't notice. I'll just literally either stuff my mouth with gum or I'll keep sneaking back every 15 minutes to get a new piece of gum. I can't even stand having only one piece of gum in my mouth. It has to be two pieces. That is all. Hope it doesn't change your opinion of me... I am going to vow to stop stealing her gum and I'll make a concentrated effort to avoid being near her purse.

addiction,Publius1688,2018/02/03,"705 days and still misery. So, I quit nicotine after twenty plus years 705 days ago tonight.  And guess what:  the sharp painful physical craving is gone, but I still want it every day: every workday at lunch, I go to the gas station for the paper and some gum and I stand there looking at the Marlboro lights, or the snus, and just think:  I really really want that.  Go to the drugstore and I look at the lozenges or nicotine gum like I'm seeing an old girlfriend.  
Almost two years and no respite.  I'm really considering buying some lozenges.

addiction,ercocet,2018/02/04,"Anxiety and the need of an addiction Just to start, I have bad HPPD, post trauma and social anxiety. It started with a bad Salvia trip at age 15. I thought I died and it gives me horrible anxiety. I started using psychedelics a lot which fucked with it. I developed bad social anxiety around age 16 but kept using drugs. I developed HPPD after I used a bunch of research chemicals and LSD for a while. It still effects me, and it makes my anxiety so much worse. I started using benzos and opiates to cope with it around age 17.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I started pain pills at 17. Stopped the pills, but then went onto Benzos for a year. Stopped the Benzos after an overdose, stayed clean for about 10 months, then relapsed on Opiates. Been clean for 15 days but I just started smoking again. 

I feel like I need to hold onto something that makes me feel different and forget about this stuff. I tried for so long to help my problems with downers, to the point where I didn't even feel like I was alive. Just anything to stop the racing thoughts and pain. It's too much for my mind to handle sometimes. I don't know what to do, I just feel like I am a failure at this game of life. Most people around me have their lives figured out, but I am sitting here thinking about how to stay clean for another day. 

I feel like I need downers because my heart is going to explode out of my chest just being in any place with people. Even when I am alone I just keep thinking about what will happen tomorrow, or what will these people think about me, or if my hallucinations with give me depersonalization and ill freak out again and people will think i am a crazy person.  

When I am high on opiates and benzos, I feel on top of everything. Like I am just where I need to be; peaceful, no worries. Like I don't even have HPPD and I don't need to think about anything; it just happens naturally, like it should. I know thats not the way I am. That is not me, that is the drug controlling me, changing me, which is scary to think about. I have tried for so long to change the way I feel.

addiction,lostandalone001,2018/02/04,I am losing hope. 6 months ago I went to a private (and pricey) treatment centre. After spending tens of thousands of dollars of my own money for two months I fear it was a waste.I have yet to experience anything close to the joy I had when I was using....I am a 29 year old female slim 5'4 and for about 3 years I spiralled into a habit of drinking at least a 26 of grey goose every day along with god knows how much cocaine. I was on the verge of death entering detox at the treatment facility. I am losing faith.

addiction,dnia99,2018/02/04,Love letter on coke I’m sorry I did something stupid. I feel worse that I wasted your time trying to help me. I didn’t listen to u and I’m sorry. I’m so mad at myself because I was clean for 17 days and I actually thought that I might stop. Now I’m lying in this cold room alone at 3am listening to the clock ticking in sync with my heartbeat. With every tick 2 heartbeats squeeze through. I want to do more to make this feeling stop and to make this message erase itself but I know I’ll only feel worse than I do now. Don’t stay if u just pity me. 7 years I’ve spent with u and will continue to love u unconditionally,0.11920398009949905,2.212616791044777,2.335791044776119,94.227368159204,86.31343283582089,4.767363184079602,19.381094527363185,6.079149491110277,-0.18179442786069666,486,14,112,4,15,164,85,134,0.19,0.698,0.112,-0.7339,0,1,1,0,0,0,8.0,0,1,0,0,4,5,2,0,1,0,8,3,0,2,0,21,25,7,0,2,3,0,4,0,0,2,0,2,2,0,6,7,1,2,5,0,1,0,2,3,0,0,5,7,15,2,18,18,1,16,0,1,0,2,8,6,0,2,9,59,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.18057790935557275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1916515376137348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1128021407623237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11933916760094156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15590898261737826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2806939967045161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12403223164609692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10169627697318444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3340219365727561,0.0,0.2470388823747795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19630424442988492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14073559279762288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14245721983747486,0.0,0.414287020907766,0.0,0.19723409434204286,0.0,0.309412980828541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1469056154404798,0.1079016353610042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12563388310724072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10914474781698193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37715475296990586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1191633633888262
addiction,[deleted],2018/02/05,"20, young dumb n broke My coke addiction is ruining my life. I do it once/twice a week spending 80-160$ on it between my boyfriend and I. He wants to quit doing it as well but my influence isn’t helping either of us. Please don’t tell me two coke heads are bad for each other because I already know that  but he is the love of my life and I’m not losing him over drugs, if we fight this addiction we will do it together.. I hope. Any who, I’m missing work because I feel depressed and don’t want to see people or get out of bed. Like today for example (I last did it 2 days ago) but it takes me days to fully recover, to feel normal again and when I finally do feel ok I’m ready to do the stupid cycle all over again, forgetting completely about the feeling I have now, maybe not truly forgetting more so just  not caring. Life should be good for me I recently got accepted into college, I have a caring family. My boyfriend says he loves me unconditionally. The only thing wrong is drugs, god I hate them so much they have taken over my life, they have made me only feel confident in myself when I’m on them, they have made me think no one can love me unless I’m on them, they have ruined me, I have ruined me but for some reason I won’t quit. Any advice? I don’t know where else to turn too, and recently found out about reddit..

addiction,Geganblack,2018/02/05,"Advice cocaine Hi guys , first post but i feel i need some advice.

I was clean for about 3 years , ( I used speed , XTC , weed and some cocaine when i was a bit younger ) 

Since a few weeks i have been using cocaine again. When I'm at work i really crave the rush and the pumped up feeling. 

I don't have any financial issues because of it but i feel a bit guilty towards my fiance , she knows i use cocaine but i lie about the amount that i use. 

I do not want to stop , but i want it to stay ""healthy""

addiction,Honcho_Lost,2018/02/05,"Does the cycle ever end? A little background information:

Drug Use/Mental Health:
I(19M) started drinking and smoking cigarettes when I was 11, and I started smoking pot at 12. All of my life I remember being extremely unhappy, for reasons unbeknownst to me. I was just constantly bored in school. The course material in classes have always been a joke to me, taking little effort to do well. Of course, when junior high rolls around I made some friends that were into percs and xans. I started to take those in the back of classrooms with my little squad of fools. After class, we'd of course just go rail adderall in the bathroom, pretty much creating a speedball effect. So I was really young to be using that many drugs, and I went a little crazy and ended up in a psychiatric hospital for a couple weeks. That was when I was 14 after my freshman year of high school. Even with all the drug use I still maintained a 4.0 GPA my freshman year, so of course when I got out of the hospital I saw no real reason to stop. My parents drug tested me for a time so I couldn't really use, until they stopped testing me towards the end of my sophomore year. I immediately started using again and even got addicted to spice(wtf) for a period, along with the usual heavy pill use and smoking. The beginning of my junior year, I was told I need to go to counselor and make some scheduling changes due to some of the courses I was enrolled in being cancelled by the school. When I got to her office, she informed me that because of the HS credits I got in junior high I could graduate that year with honors and even a semester of college done. So I changed my schedule for that, eager to leave home and make it on my own. You see the drugs have never changed my motivation, even to this day. At the same time I made the decision to leave early I made some alphabay orders on the deep web, and bought 25i-nbome(psychedelic, very similar to LSD to an untrained user, is dosed onto blotter paper just like acid is, except it's much cheaper). The price was $40 dollars a sheet(a sheet is 100 hits). I loved LSD, I had not done the nbome yet, but had read great things, so I eagerly ordered two sheets with my business partner. In our area that was dry of psychedelics, we had no problem selling 10 strips to pot dealers at $80, a price that they eagerly accepted considering the lack of acid like drugs in the region. So we were selling $4 worth of the shit for $80. Life was pretty good at the time if you haven't put that together by now. We stopped buying sheets, and started buying pages. We had set up connections to push our shit in lots of nearby towns and the money was coming all directions. We also had 1000s of stockpile hits of acid, so of course I was taking like 5 hits a day. Fast-forward - shit gets hot as hell with the police and I decide to quit dealing before I inevitably got popped. I graduated that year at 17, summa cum laude. I noticed that I was hearing things that others were not, and that I felt the constant presence of people behind me, even when no one was there. I became paranoid and my eating habits got shitty. I became thin as hell. My hair grew to a Legolas-like length. OF COURSE, no one in my life notices anything is wrong. For whatever reason, whatever I do just ends in getting praised for being so smart or handsome. Paranoia and hallucinations that led to weight loss(I was already skinny before), weren't met with concerns, just people telling me I should be a high fashion model with cheekbones and hair like that. I smile when people say that. On the inside I'm trying to build up the courage to ask for help. When people see you as person with the whole world in front of them, they think you're bitching if you have any issues. So I continue on like everything is okay. And eventually I get myself clean for the first year of college, but trying this on my own, I crumble and start using again. I've been at college for two years now. And have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. I'll be graduating a semester or two early. Last semester I didn't Dean's List. I didn't put enough effort in, funnily enough it was the same effort I always put in. I realized I'm not a fucking mastermind like I thought. And that I'm an irresponsible idiot who just gets high as fuck all day and scrapes by. I always get myself clean for a period and then fucking start getting high and blowing my money on designer clothes and partying, andddd somehow I end up back in the psychiatric hospital. I just wanna be fucking normal like fuckin' a' man will I ever be able to beat this shit? Is it just ingrained in me at this point? I've never had any real consequences and I fear that in coming years that everything around me will crumble to the ground :/ I'm pretty sure I'll kill myself or be dead in the next three years anyway. I'm such a fucking waste of potential. I became a Mensa International member at 12 only to be a 19 year old who looks like a blend of Legolas and a soundcloud rapper, and can't even formulate a proper sentence because the language center in his brain is fucking fried from drug use.

addiction,LatiosEX,2018/02/05,"I have an entertainment/music addiction I recently got an iPad which I use for school and recreation which has facilitated my addiction.

Whenever I'm watching a YouTube video, I go through the suggested videos on the side and open the ones I like in a new tab, and then I watch the original video, go to the next few videos I opened previously, and the cycle repeats.

The process also occurs when I'm listening to music and I listen to another piece from the same singer or band. 

It just ends up turning into a long cycle that ends up in me never finishing. I'll spend hours opening new tabs and listening to songs or watching videos.

Any tips",7.0764459930313635,7.1342553902439025,7.3799303135888525,73.44878048780487,64.20325203252034,11.256213704994195,35.457607433217184,10.914260884657429,3.902292450638793,515,22,95,13,7,168,79,123,0.0,0.957,0.043,0.5859,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,13,0,2,2,0,2,1,17,12,11,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,2,4,0,0,4,10,0,0,0,7,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,7,10,1,13,11,3,26,0,0,3,0,5,10,0,2,15,59,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4463470670725947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16371342122020918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13921569425961267,0.2146653421808137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3626398999433693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2326926399687009,0.0,0.16373219658654786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20160662146177052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000151860177099,0.0,0.0,0.18116955292449272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1578916344904098,0.3954370734303283,0.21772059449324305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1387226475860559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2021349580467766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20718619153630288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2226750922165049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17681117401324026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,jr101014,2018/02/06,"trying to beat my first relapse First time poster. Going through a 4 month relapse on oxy after being clean for a little over three years. Went to treatment in 2014 after being addicted to opiates for around three years. My wife was pregnant at the time with our first child and had no idea she had married an addict. She stood by me while I went through rehab and things have been going great until four months ago. My old dealer ended up coming into my place of business and I ended up giving him my phone number. I have been using ever since, roughly 90mg of oxy per day for the last four months or so. I snorted my last 90mg Sunday before noon. I had a 8mg sub that I took yesterday morning. I was having major anxiety on the way home from work yesterday about going into wd's over night so I stopped and bought some kratom on the way home. I have dabbled with kratom the past couple months when my dealer was out. I know its just trading one substance for another and after reading the sub on wd's I'm scared of getting hooked on it as well. There is no way in hell I can go through WD's without something to ease them. I have obligations to my job and more importantly to my wife and now 3 year old son. My plans are to use kratom sparingly until this Friday. By then the elimidrol I ordered will be in and hopefully that can help. My dealer texted me today to let me know he had some and I basically told him I was done fore a while. I feel fine today but I know that's probally still from the 8mg sub I took yesterday morning. Any advice or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated.

addiction,vinsomm,2018/02/06,"Question as a non-addict I found out my friend has been using heroin and meth. She’s been sober for 8 years and has recently relapsed 5-6 months ago. I found out a month ago and she was sober for a month and then found out she’s been using meth again for a week now. However what’s scary (and something I’ve never seen her go through) is she is in like this state of paranoia/psychosis. She thinks people are in the attic, she thinks people are following her around and switching cars to trick her, she thinks people are waiting for her outside her window at night to arrest or kidnap her. It’s actually quite terrifying as this is completely out of character. She is also a grad student and somehow has maintained her 4.0 gpa and will be graduating (hopefully) in May. It’s such a weird thing to consider rehab or an intervention when I feel like we’d be throwing away her 7 years of hard work in school right before the finish line. What should I do ? What should my next  step be? She admittedly needs help but adamantly doesn’t want it...

addiction,Joe_Montainya,2018/02/06,"Best approach to help my brothers relapse (I'm mad and hurt) My brother just had a week long relapse. The worst he's had in about 2 years. (He's had addiction problems for a decade) He's had small one time/one pill relapses a couple times but this was the longest in a while. 

He used to be far far worse. Adultry... emptying bank accounts and leaving his wife to fend for herself and thier kids while he was in the military. He's not that guy anymore but still has these moments.

He's my best friend, co-worker and I was soon to move in with his family as we embarked on trying to start a business together. (He already agreed long ago to never being allowed access business money)

Then out of nowhere this past week happened. Im normally just glad to see it's nothing major and I give in to him not going back to AA or rehab or counseling. It's been a while since he's done any of that anyway. I guess I'm torn between...do I expect him to be perfect for the rest of his life or should I expect a few bumps in the road? I want to support him and be encouraging but I'm also furious at what he puts our 70 year old mother through when he does this. And how he can easily lie to my face every time about it. I don't know where to draw the line between supportive love and just straight tough love. 

I'd really like to have a sit down with my family and some sort of counselor or therapist to let everyone have a turn to speak and establish some sort of game plan for supporting him. Would this be a good idea? And help would be much appreciated

Also as of a few hours ago he sounded not fucked up and claims he's coming down off whatever he took last night. So there's at least an opening for dialogue at the moment.",2.4393956562795083,4.1380649745042515,3.874354107648724,88.24310812086875,76.30878186968837,7.086270066100094,25.08111425873465,7.908726449838941,1.330318677998112,1348,47,285,21,30,445,199,353,0.056,0.737,0.207,0.9964,1,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,2,0,0,4,16,20,3,0,19,0,24,8,1,3,2,51,45,30,0,8,13,4,0,1,1,3,4,2,0,2,11,18,0,0,2,1,3,6,5,7,1,1,10,3,22,13,50,25,11,56,0,1,1,3,40,22,1,9,28,178,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11715966043868295,0.0,0.0,0.19053377623607126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11859733305482313,0.17188963705049026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07308421930120564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10658272404985658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0826388523764703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2255691519726325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09257707206747952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11891503059200545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09404892314904792,0.1099805283104216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09054926733987287,0.1026935029227165,0.0,0.0,0.20262889237597165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08303211653862896,0.09935555299037936,0.0,0.1030963343176369,0.06107845821440053,0.09014188911097523,0.0,0.0,0.1183918342926918,0.10641355634771996,0.09503658061838584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14407159245783718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10583765439556256,0.0,0.11505032806156072,0.12132209917244388,0.1160875255138647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05906345623275343,0.0876035133806129,0.0,0.1137966668496834,0.0,0.10989676076813372,0.07591020937880387,0.05250508448234436,0.0,0.0,0.1902175671651439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19399422101505828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11422506184532122,0.0790038253056317,0.0,0.08288854861007261,0.0,0.0,0.10085460367891952,0.10529912765471676,0.10312168135098627,0.0,0.11277312781223155,0.0,0.07282538403548655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10259358660411363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10283559007235232,0.0,0.10803841411683868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06884891379836569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08564077027962115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08890143070218069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07606879128500578,0.0,0.08582677766921272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3658717230169098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12478254793899154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1880022663740479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1194046502954154,0.07296600797108824,0.11689799313947342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09282076051274676,0.0,0.0,0.06338940055222518,0.0,0.17241410642782234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07824043985459443,0.0,0.1095225110890086,0.15268916039905642,0.0,0.0,0.13841608183787266
addiction,CurrentDesire,2018/02/07,"After a 13 year Opiate addiction, I am officially 2 years clean and sober. Ask me how. I've seen many posts that people have written showing much similarity in the things I have been through during my time as an addict. 

Instead of replying to every thread separately, I figured I'd make a new thread and combine all questions and answers into one. 

If you're new to wanting to get sober or looking for answers, please ask. I been up and I've been down. Two years sober and looking to pay it forward.

addiction,rightwrist,2018/02/07,"Looking for a better future Hey there. I'm new to reddit and I just stumbled onto this , I'm only 19 but the past year has been the worst of my life. Binge drinking along with a lot of cocaine, it seems like the only time I am enjoying myself is when I'm alone in my room or with others just chugging beers and snorting away until the comedown, drink .. repeat.. until I run out of money.. sometimes I have to go steal food just to make it by. I'm a hard worker at my job, but when I'm home alone I can't help but think how nice it would be to have some beer , or a gram of white, sometimes I buy a ball (3.5grams) and 50 beers and just think to myself how great the next 3 days will be.. how do I fill this gap? I feel so alone. Plenty of people want me to stop, but why should I? I want a good future .. this is holding me back .. suicide is often running through my mind, but I know I can do better then this. Hopefully someone can give me some advice or past stories of addiction, or even current, we're all in this together . Can't wait to hear from you all.

addiction,Herley11,2018/02/07,"Sue the drug companies I read an article yesterday about some states suing the pharmaceutical companies for the burden put on taxpayers for the massive opioid addiction. My first thought was “what about the people who are addicted?”  The drug companies had to know opioids were highly addictive when they created the drug, yet doctors were handing them out like candy.  It’s my opinion that the companies and the government knew the toll it would take on society, but chose profits over human lives. 

I am not an addict, but I am the widow of someone who was.  He was in his thirties when he became addicted to opioids from a back injury.  He was a sweet, gentle man who worked hard to take care of his family, and I loved him dearly; however, my love was not enough to save him.  He died alone in a hotel while away on a job.  Cause of death?  Huffing computer duster.  The opioids had him and would not turn loose.  I’m guessing he did not want the shame of asking for pain killers so he turned to huffing.  

The point of my post is when are the drug companies going to be held accountable for this epidemic and chaos they have caused? Because you see...I am their victim too. His death crippled me. I am the devastation left behind from the greed of these companies.

addiction,MemeMan1984,2018/02/07,"From addiction to recovery TL;DR I've done a moderate amount of drugs, trying to stay sober now.

It's slightly amusing to see how many ""users"" are online. With the ice breaker outta the way I'll start my story.

Today seems like a brighter day. Last night I finished off a pint of heineken and smoked the rest of my weed. Decided for the thousandth time I'm calling it quits. I'm going to really miss smoking weed but it's for the best. Alcohol is the worst though.

Experimented with harder drugs in my youth but never had a direct line to anything. Tried some shit my friend concocted from the anarchist handbook, pretty sure it was ether because I was a rambling idiot that couldn't shut up. Anyways, joined the military at 22 and got out at 28, had enough of that shit so all I did was drink and smoke cigarettes. Btw I was never a good smoker I could make a pack last a week, sometimes a fortnight. After I got out of the military I quit smoking cigs in 2012. Temporarily tried that synthetic shit you can buy in headshops when I got out but it's garbage, really regret trying that shit. Recently had a medical scare, still scared about my physical state. I go more in-dept on r/dying if interested.

I met this friend though craigslist a few years back and we hung out a lot getting fucked up and playing Metal music together. But he turned out to be a real scumfuck and a bum so I've pretty much cut ties with him. But he did help hook me up through some cool people that I can still get in contact with, just a mutual dealer type of thing. I know I'll be very tempted to get in contact with them in a few days because withdraws really hit me. But I feel like I have a reason to live longer now than I have before, so really trying to stay clean. 

I'm considering this day 1 of my recovery. Feb 7th, 2018. It's not that I want to stay sober but I need to for health reason. Detoxing my body by following online guides.

addiction,laughs_at_things_,2018/02/07,"Am I addicted to Kratom? How should I get off this shit? So I have a serious problem with kratom, a legal drug that feels just like opiates. I decided recently that I need to quit ASAP. I’m playing with fire here; addiction is a slippery slope to some real suffering. What I’d like to know is whether physical addiction has already begun to take hold on me, or if it is just my mind playing tricks. This will inform how I will go about getting off the junk. 

Some details:    
Towards the beginning of September, I started using kratom on weekends. I would always take 6 grams, which is the high end of common. It’s the maximum dose recommended for pain management in the completely opiate naive, but lower than what a full blown addict takes. I steadily began using more and more during the week, and by the end of December, I was using everyday. Since then, so for a little over a month, I’ve been taking 6 gram per day, a couple hours before bed. But even after all this time, I still don’t have any noticeable tolerance; 6 grams is still plenty.    
Here’s the reason why I think I may be physically addicted. Although I feel completely normal and healthy during the day, at night I get very uncomfortable and anxious until I take some kratom. The other night I forced myself to skip it and I felt empty and depressed. Furthermore, I was irritable the entire next day. I’m not getting any stomach cramps, nausea, or diarrhea, which I know are some hallmarks of opiate withdrawal. However, I did have a runny nose today, and since my dose it has dried up. (This may just be a coincidence though. My roommate has a cold that I’m probably just catching...)

So my question is do I have mild physical dependence or am I just severely psychologically addicted. If it is physical, I think I will let myself ween of it gradually. If not, I will go cold turkey. 

What do you guys think? Should I ween of either way? Cold turkey either way? I’d love some guidance here. This is very difficult for me, and I can’t really talk about it with anyone... thanks in advance",4.13175,6.074905876923076,5.410817307692309,77.9769951923077,72.28205128205127,8.772435897435898,28.08493589743589,9.354420925462401,2.6784935897435886,1612,62,290,38,32,537,205,390,0.124,0.807,0.069,-0.9691,2,0,1,1,0,0,59.0,0,1,0,2,19,14,2,0,21,0,38,15,3,7,1,64,69,26,0,9,18,0,4,2,0,9,11,0,1,1,21,11,0,1,12,3,0,4,4,8,0,0,6,8,37,6,34,51,11,45,0,2,0,1,6,13,1,15,28,200,58,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5483567732180007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09251428154067236,0.0,0.06975764274829192,0.0,0.0,0.11402168778089583,0.0,0.0,0.0947099681786268,0.0,0.058619555097279424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07133762181238312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1757993262781013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09276210801908123,0.0,0.16220039951617307,0.0,0.07220717678593636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09722227246193772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14850629330314558,0.0,0.0,0.055372391040249776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08477924133286198,0.0598919183606603,0.08049498579169864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17520182891337985,0.0,0.09529100754238996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08301007668651618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08857654303485933,0.0,0.0,0.08256083255960918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09214732031379202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08572722171932153,0.0,0.08191533558129786,0.08402494342092685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07566458502044976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08464970235683764,0.0,0.06691649560848252,0.0,0.0,0.06216277457443725,0.0,0.0,0.089159737990767,0.15734740333682468,0.08214074373268118,0.0,0.09544698620291747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08920661534943193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09038857742799568,0.0802190107256199,0.0,0.0,0.09391466504525812,0.08916910638533578,0.0,0.0954228667940177,0.053707006986127584,0.08619659831576308,0.08277719404621875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0947099681786268,0.08605567795700861,0.13869876796551855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05933902046639208,0.0,0.13390187567451925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3151683676601825,0.06738359721286885,0.0,0.07718423330256675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16115472657794785,0.08236770610809639,0.0,0.04888500765182485,0.0,0.07946601308740868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21722021270729625,0.0,0.1383457200875167,0.0,0.13308903627977978,0.06724757957362144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07564827213504317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059554155264340124,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,MostEcho,2018/02/08,"Not so much a major addiction but something I am seeking help with and don't really know the correct place to post. I am a 30 year old hetrosexual man with a few bisexual kinks but I am comfortable in my sexuality to know that these are only kinks and not needs. I have a wife, who I absolutely adore and love and am extremely sexually attracted to. She is also very aware of what I talk about above and has no issue with it. The real reason I am posting this, is because I want to be less of a ""pervert"" in a sense. I would never dream of cheating on my wife, not just because of moral reasons but because I truthfully don't want to. I do however have a major attraction to what an average person may call odd fetishes. Nothing horrible or illegal, no one gets hurt or forced to do anything against their will. The fetishes that I like would all be found on all common porn sites, youporn, xhamster etc but I suppose they would be very specific in terms of categories i.e. Cuckold, voyeur and such, basically not you basic lesbian or normal sex catagories. I also have a thing for sex/adult stores, I get a rush when I am in them. This is really the reason I am here. I want to cut this sort of behaviour out. Those stores are filled with ""dirty old men"" and I don't want to be one of those. I tell myself that I will not go into them but I get caught in the moment and the excitement just takes over and then when I leave, I am filled with disgust in myself. My real question is, what are some actual techniques that I could use to stop myself for this ""sleazy"" kind of behaviour. I know that this may seem tame to some of you but it is something that I would like to put behind me and I also know that my wife would most likely not have an issue with this but it is something I want to get a handle on for my own sanity. I also am a writer and I try to be as focused as I can with my work but I find more often than not, things like this behaviour gets in the way. Please reserve judgment, all and any advice is helpful.",4.605347091932458,4.981867463414638,5.6985365853658525,82.29362101313322,69.48780487804878,8.844277673545967,28.452157598499063,8.841846274778883,2.0176641651031892,1580,52,328,26,26,526,194,410,0.08,0.75,0.17,0.9907,1,0,3,0,0,0,40.0,0,2,4,1,13,16,3,0,20,0,45,5,0,4,6,82,67,33,0,13,20,3,0,4,0,9,1,0,0,3,26,21,0,1,11,1,2,6,13,4,0,2,2,0,50,12,52,50,15,35,1,1,0,4,21,15,0,12,15,253,76,1,0.0,0.0,0.0883390782061287,0.09868531773625637,0.0,0.08845971853767078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2895703757484892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0615599206778206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07449413964672565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16554910570484124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09243587068049157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07227663090238658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10095900316788546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08273796329687864,0.0,0.0,0.0992556940692566,0.0,0.0,0.23647717597467105,0.0,0.05144729024614551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12135363678278285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09690859582473613,0.0,0.0,0.18896859827489987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0942675760547161,0.19900009689704654,0.0,0.0,0.09585261841267728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17690324214010275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0817021032161835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06654609251574578,0.06712294031761849,0.06981825250819326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.088695015255655,0.08686091997462829,0.0,0.1899809526349056,0.0,0.1226837997975965,0.06884813642434284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07904270260187535,0.09457907572411972,0.09936896955861384,0.0,0.0,0.17339533613482033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09100235682589287,0.1014084152442943,0.0,0.0,0.20607392242703454,0.1159849202114028,0.2792234981758652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08241031439127329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2090710795549809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07568272777370141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06806333107645778,0.07276034902029284,0.07912260412653953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1202812164802256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06146034952313322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07818430174194131,0.0,0.1493847656608787,0.26696915607232913,0.07185431715599941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06590308164059668,0.0,0.0,0.32153085482757154,0.0,0.0,0.05829495819991332
addiction,howslifebeensince69,2018/02/08,"Consequences of getting help, will I lose my son? Hi guys. I really need some help regarding this. 

I’m a 25 year old male with a pain-killer addiction, the addiction started around 4 years ago. The drug I am addicted to is Dihydrocodeine and also Codeine. These are of course opiate-based pain meds. I have never took anything else other than those two drugs. The amount I take per day varies on how many I can get hold of, I wouldn’t hesitate to take 20 30mg dihydrocodeine tablets a day if I could. 

I really, really want help. My life is falling apart, I’ve lost my job, I don’t blame the pills fully for it but they had a massive part to play. I know I’d be a better and stronger person without this putrid addiction in my life. I would love nothing more than to wake up and not have to worry about getting my pills. 

I’ve tried going cold turkey but needless to say this failed, the longest I lasted was 6 days and I have never felt so sick and defeated in my life. My main issue with getting help through the NHS is that I have a son who’s a toddler, he stays with me a few nights a week (not with his Mum anymore) - I limit the amount of pills I take when he’s in my care, I take enough to function but not so many that I’m in another planet because my son means absolutely everything to me, he’s the only positive I have in my life, the thought of never being able to see him is excruciating and it would end me. It would hurt him as well as I can tell he really loves and adores me. So I don’t want to get help for them to take his details, alert social work/health visitors etc and for us to be separated because of this. Do you know what I mean?

Can anyone shed any light as to how the process would work? I know what I need to do in terms of going to my doctor but will admitting to this pain killer addiction strike up some sort of red flag and will authorities intervene with me and my son? I know everyone must say it but I’m really not a bad Dad, I’ve provided for him since he was born, I have a savings account purely for him and his Mum, so I can continue to provide, I feed, wash, clothe him and most importantly give him all the love and attention in the world. But I don’t want to be seen as an addict who is incapable of taking care of him, will this happen?

Sorry for the length of this message. I’m really desperate for help. Thank you.

addiction,LouisSeaGays,2018/02/08,How about addiction to reddit? Ive never been so addicted to a website in my life. I use Facebook to message a few certain people and interact with auction pages with others in my area from time to time. Other than that all I do is branch around the Internet from this place. I’m horrifically addicted. Anyone else? I have other addictions as well so I know that I’m just prone to that in general but reddit? Holy shit it might be stealing my life a bit. I give myself a lot of excuses to be on here. My job is a security type so I can speak hours upon hours on here at it and be paid for it. It makes me feel like I’m winning somehow but how? I’m not doing shit really? Just know the topical  meme and news bullshit...what is that doing for me? Nothing. This is becoming a rant so I’ll just end it here.,0.4004491017964078,2.69644825149701,3.0700928143712574,87.92382185628746,87.4431137724551,6.453772455089822,21.523652694610767,7.7348632917899725,1.151359520958084,626,22,132,13,20,218,99,167,0.123,0.7959999999999999,0.081,-0.8836,1,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,1,16,8,2,0,8,0,15,8,2,4,3,27,26,12,0,0,6,0,1,1,0,1,6,1,0,0,14,6,0,1,3,0,2,0,2,3,1,0,2,2,14,5,24,20,5,16,0,0,0,0,5,10,2,3,7,98,28,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6283919038335459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10076301313819257,0.1476547217373911,0.0,0.12828584367549736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.159154935535869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15732759569008134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12038296453972472,0.0,0.1276360896835229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07286486390158255,0.10295011872116468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13824063153978158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2838328691542769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14300402966584913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15839495253792518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20357416884506413,0.0704034346703942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1225146765482358,0.0,0.0,0.09619258741176216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15287482691064366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11114425535217194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13827461907116248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09990569671097843,0.0,0.15056121523551996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09231867832458752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29584767043039417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16805998135288072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12446223852878348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12956956138483208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,dokidoki-hima,2018/02/08,"My boyfriend of over a year has a severe anime/manga addiction, resorts to stealing, I don't know what to do anymore Let me start off by saying, I will not leave him. I love him. He is sweet, funny, and kind, I want to help him. When we first started dating, I knew he liked to collect things, but I didn't know how bad it was until I moved in a little past our six month mark. Everytime he would talk about buying more anime, I felt bad for being judgemental or voicing how he shouldn't spend so much. I thought I was just being bitter or hateful initially. However, it's only gotten worse and worse. Imagine living in a room jam packed with over 110 different anime on dvd/vhs, and over 2,000 manga (Japanese comics for those who aren't familiar with them) which have to be stored on invidiual shelves or else my boyfriend will get mad and upset. He will not allow any of his collections to touch the floor, or be placed in boxes or storage. He won't let anything sit on top of his comic books. He won't let them sit in the car seat. I have to carry them during car rides when he buys more. 



My boyfriend is nearly thirty years old, yet he doesn't want to invest money in a newer car, our house, or preparing for our future. We've gotten a new place and will be adding a roommate, yet his main concern is where his manga and anime will be. He wants to jam pack our new, even smaller bedroom with his 10 different bookshelves, with the intention of adding more and more. We struggle sometimes with me working an almost minimum wage job and him working minimum wage, yet he has seriously uttered the sentence, ""Manga is more important than food.""



If his day is bad, he heads straight to the bookstore, and gets something without fail. However, his desire for more anime is not inhibited by money in the slightest. He started stealing awhile back to fuel the addiction, from several different stores. I've warned him not to, and to be more careful, yet he continues to steal. He's been caught once trying to switch store tags on items, and ended up returning to the store to try again afterwards despite my constant harping of, ""NO, NO NO!"" Once, he dashed through a crowded shopping center with an armful of stolen anime merchandise. I'm the only one- to his knowledge-who is aware that he steals. No one else knows about this except a friend I confided in. He tells people he buys things, when they are stolen.



He doesn't think he has an issue. None of his friends do either. They laugh and joke and all have fun regarding his massive collection. They don't have to see the bad side of it. They don't see my boyfriend saving copious amounts of hentai and cheating on me with people who look more like his anime fantasy. They don't see him ignoring me to watch anime for hours or spending hours 'organizing the collection'. I poked him in the leg to tell him something funny while he was organizing his comics and he slapped me on the arm for interrupting. I felt worthless in that moment. 90% of what he talks about is anime and manga. Which I don't have an issue with. Letting it become his whole life is the problem.



Anime used to be a special interest and a source of passion for me. I still like it, but I know it is ruining my relationship. My boyfriend will get mad if you even waste one bite of food off a plate and will lick a plate clean in a restaurant- calls me wasteful if I can't eat every bite- yet spends 300-400$ on anime related things during Christmas alone. He works all during the week and has used up all his days off to go to abime conventions and events, so he won't go to therapy because he says it's a waste of a day off.

I was at a party where I ended up doing line after line and also got 2 grams to take home. That was Sunday night, haven't touched it since. That's mainly because my toilet has been busted since then too and when I do blow I drink a shit ton of water and piss a lot. So I've been holding off until it's fixed because I don't wanna piss in my shower more than I absolutely have to.

addiction,ChunkyMunky666,2018/02/09,"How do I know my friend is an addict? So last new years right when it turned into 2017-2018 my good friend Sasha came into town and I hadn't seen her in two years because she had moved to Colorado. I am not going to lie though growing up Sasha and I would smoke pot occasionally so I already knew she liked to smoke weed every now and than which was really no big deal because she was a 'responsible stoner'. So back to new years, well it was 2017-2018 new years and I hadn't seen her in two years and she was apparently in town but wasn't picking up her phone or answering Facebook but she did get to hangout with my friend Max. I was on Maxs Snapchat story and saw that he was with her and that they were hanging out for new years. Which made me super jealous so the next day I contacted Max about what was up and why he didn't invite me over. He ended up confessing to me that he didn't want to invite me because all Sasha would talk about was cocaine. He would try interjecting and discussing something else like college but no Sasha wanted to talk about coke. He told me that it was just very weird and something was very off with her ending our conversation with ""I don't know man some people just change..""

What do I do since Sasha is notorious for not picking up her phone or going on Facebook. When we would hang out she would always contact me last minute because she was awful at planning things out.

addiction,soberjunkie,2018/02/09,"Is it possible to stay sober/clean without AA/NA? My psychiatrist doesn't think so Really dislike AA/NA. What I dislike about it doesn't matter as much at this point, but my reasons are petty really, and probably one of my character defetcts - I hate preachy people and I hate people who complain about stupid shit. 

Anyway, is this really the only way for a life of sobriety to take place?

If so, I'll do it, I'll go more than my current twice a week. But I'll use or buy drugs before or after a meeting, never being high in the meeting itself, so not sure I'm working it correctly, anyway. 

I can stay clean 3-4 months on my own at a clip (making rehab somewhat useless imo), but then i get the usual, eh, I'm fine let me take a Xanax or 20 and you know the rest, a week or two later I'm coming out of a hazy coke binge. I'm on Suboxone, otherwise it'd be a heroin binge ( thank you Suboxone).

Other than an overdose, yes I almost died and that didn't stop me, consequences have been relatively light. Came damn near close to losing my 150k+ a year job, something I value dearly and succeed at when clean, but fail miserably at when high. Reading emails I sent high makes me cringe, ouch. And now that I'm in a position of relative authority makes it even more cringey, my poor subordinates :(. O, and my fiance who I love and she loves me dearly is just distraught over the whole thing, has affected our relationship to say the least, which I value zero when I'm high and 100% when I'm clean, sending terrible signals to her.

addiction,Marcuspie,2018/02/09,"My dad and talking about his problem. A little back story, my dad is addicted to alcohol , he doesn't drink too much because of my mums influence but he grabs every chance and excuse he gets to grab a drink. Theres often times that he asks me to get beer or any other form of alcohol and when i say no or stay silent he gets annoyed and angrily says nevermind.

He and my mum went to a professional and talked about his problem and there was progress, he admitted he has a problem but eventually stopped working on it. 

What is the best way to talk to someone like this, and tell him you are uncomfortable with what he asks without him getting angry? 

I don't want to be someone who helps to get him things and when he doesn't get what he wants he tends to play a victim and making me and most likely my mum feel guilty.

addiction,3z3ra_br00ks,2018/02/09,"Pain Management I got a firsthand taste of what addiction was. I did choose to take these things and I strongly felt that if I didn't I would be in more pain than I could bear. Over 10 years of pain pills and being addicted without really knowing what addiction truly is.


Everything IS about these little yellow oval pills that run my life.


The way I feel when taking them is great. It enabled me to function in my day to day life, but my world still revolved around these yellow oval pills. I always make sure I had enough if I was going to go someplace for any extended period. My decision to go places revolved around when my doctor’s appointments are. When my refills can be picked up and other little factors that made my life revolve around something I felt I had to have.


Everything IS about these little yellow oval pills that run my life.


I am counting pills daily making sure I didn’t take too many. I would get depressed if I took too many one day and had to cut back another. I felt I was going to have a bad day so therefore I did. It is a vicious cycle of take my pills, feel good for a little while and over do whatever it is I am doing. When you do this, you get into this mentality and feeling that you can take more pills to offset the pain you are going to be in and you just keep over doing it.


Everything IS about these little yellow oval pills that run my life.


Mow the grass. Take a pill. Clean the house. Take a pill. Work on my car. Take 2 pills. Hate doing that shit. But I am thinking you get the idea at this point.


Everything IS about these little yellow oval pills that run my life.


I don’t know what finally made me say fuck it I am not doing this anymore. But one morning I woke up and decided my life was not going to be ran by these little yellow bastards anymore. Don't get me wrong I still have back issues and some days are better than others.


Everything IS about these little yellow oval pills that run my life.


In July of 2017 I made a wise but hard decision and gave up pain management for my back. What does this mean exactly? I went from taking 6 Hydrocodone 10/325 a day or Percocet or whatever pain medication I got that month to absolutely nothing. I tried to taper off but every time I would get to feeling bad I would take a half a pill or something just trying to stretch out my last few pills.


Everything IS about these little yellow oval pills that run my life.


I finally ran out. 


Everything WAS about these little yellow oval pills that DID run my life.


Hell part 2 started. This is where I now know how people that go through withdrawal feel. There are no words that can describe what this feels like. Have you ever had your nerve endings feel like they are on fire all over your body? Restless legs, lack of sleep, nausea, sweats, cold sweats, hot flash's. Worse of all no one mentions the pain. Not just physical either.


Everything WAS about these little yellow oval pills that DID run my life.


Mental pain was the worst. For days all I could think about was how can I get some more pills. What if I did this or that? But that is not what I was really wanting. I wanted it all to just end. I wanted those addicting chemicals out of my brain. I wanted the shit out of my body. I was tired of feeling controlled by a little yellow pill.


Everything WAS about these little yellow oval pills that DID run my life.


It was after about seven days when I finally realized I was going to be able to make it. Seven days of hell. Very little sleep and some alcohol when the times got too bad. Many breakdowns due to emotional swings. But I finally realized. I AM GOING TO BE OKAY. Back still hurts sometimes but I know my limits. You know what?


I CONTROL MY LIFE!

addiction,adhdpunk,2018/02/10,Any dopamine 'experts' that can explain me the damage I have done? So I have been abusing methylphenidate for a few years on and off. Never thought it would become a problem. What it does is basically increasing the transmission of dopamine by blocking things (inhibitors?) that regulate the release of the stuff. I snorted it for a few months straight. But now I have quit that and only take it orally in large doses varying up to 150mg daily. I have made a rather drastic decision of asking my friend to tell my mom that i have been abusing it if I ever do it again which would definitaly root out the issue since my mom wouldnt allow me to touch it by probably hiding it. What I'm wondering is the long term consequences of my idiotic habit. How long will it take for my brain to recover from the wiring of only seeking this drug to satisfy the daily dopamine release? Have I increased my chances of self induced psychosis? When will the cravings go away? Thanks in advance.,5.1077329192546586,6.873445239130441,4.991149068322984,82.68739130434784,69.43478260869566,7.648447204968945,33.25155279503106,8.192908349453996,2.5993335403726716,780,37,140,11,14,241,113,184,0.121,0.802,0.077,-0.8609,0,0,3,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,2,7,5,1,0,13,0,18,3,1,5,2,22,28,7,0,6,3,2,1,0,1,5,2,0,0,1,19,3,0,1,5,0,0,4,2,3,0,0,5,2,16,2,24,18,5,22,0,1,0,0,7,8,0,2,10,104,35,0,0.0,0.3564631836148017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10229563017381817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14062909255946512,0.0,0.1413312727333545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16613498464135446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16792646474447104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13163982529593968,0.15393921639905142,0.0,0.0,0.17444775326489964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13606998233684872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11621965408125855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08549122413604616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15700687745166805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26624661369226643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14233782015220225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3523569538032467,0.12006952748230007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11601870274231227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2288132741002256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1621859256509092,0.14393848071897214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15999780580782574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1569283394370535,0.0,0.0,0.12443490488080752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1722031138787326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22620501350658875,0.0,0.13147997204996487,0.13849312247230156,0.0,0.0,0.09993712388222108,0.0,0.0,0.11942236567327197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16313184302178674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21371828327753667,0.0,0.0,0.09687016193906574

I'm trying to come up with good questions, but I want to ask things that most people want to know about or would find interesting. If you've never been addicted to something, what would you like to know about addiction?

addiction,Runechi,2018/02/10,"Currently feeling withdrawal symptoms from energy drink addiction And I’m considering relapsing on purpose to feel better. This is a really really important days of my life, I want to pass this driving school. But I can’t seem to focus, I feel so disconnected to the world. And I just can’t. I have to pass this, failing is not an option. But it takes me too long to actually comprehend the questions. I have to read a lot of times to understand them. It’s pissing me off and I’m thinking this might be withdrawal. It’s been a while, maybe around 2 weeks since I last drink energy drink.

addiction,SwoonDunn,2018/02/10,"Any Recommendations On How to Quit Drinking All Together? Hi Guys and Girls,

I am a responsible financial professional in investment banking, former military, and college graduate. I have been drinking heavily for over 10 years. I have always been in good shape and work out regularly but in 2016 I had a serious shoulder surgery and couldn't exercise so I gained a lot of weight and still drank the way I do without exercise (not that that matters). I am 30 years old and in in the same year I had a liver scan and was told I have fatty liver. It was a wake up call and I lost a ton of weight and am back in good shape. As a disabled veteran of foreign war I have to regularly go to the VA on an annual basis. This year, the doctor seriously recommended that I give up drinking all together. My doctor also pointed out that he's never seen someone with fatty liver at my age. I have a drink at least 4 days a week, and at least 2 days a week I binge drink. I wouldn't say I'm an alcoholic but I would say I drink way too frequently. I am a very social person with many friends and I work in downtown SF so there's always something to do and it typically involves going out drinking. My liver has taken on too heavy of a loud for my age. I want to stop drinking but I have been unsuccessful. I value my life and anyone here knows that it's easier said than done to give up substances. Is there anyone with experience, who has changed their lifestyle and either given up drinking all together, or agrees to only have a drink on truly special occasions? If so, can you recommend anything to me on how to do this and how to choose life over alcohol? I would sincerely appreciate any advice at all. Again I'm not to the point where my daily life is affected, but I am to the point where it is started to affect my health and I know I need to change. 

Thank you.",3.5272525327632636,5.057177245283022,5.238663444558046,80.28989218328844,73.04312668463612,8.567376150199832,27.887443070917374,9.130062681391069,2.352308783344177,1462,56,288,32,29,498,183,371,0.053,0.8079999999999999,0.138,0.9856,0,0,13,0,0,0,31.0,0,2,1,5,17,10,1,0,21,0,33,29,6,5,5,55,52,30,1,7,10,0,2,0,1,3,10,4,0,3,12,22,15,1,3,12,2,2,6,4,0,0,15,8,37,6,51,33,10,56,0,1,2,0,19,32,0,3,20,206,49,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07119618361586125,0.0,0.15572650286270598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058264671147251826,0.12124770734725185,0.0,0.0,0.09909214020592956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10188828608941307,0.0,0.05995608546205465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0560234536569184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07439636176162731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15414861648188208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09397501500591647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14914689695477665,0.0,0.07455922793909299,0.0,0.7137329238313765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07126929379109515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05629005968943266,0.0,0.0,0.13978443653912212,0.08281398094983199,0.1222199922174548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07214106647264891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07744485285823285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0800819156587233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15438569056525064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07953332500931543,0.061941430816379366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07386677282592917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054023427416339316,0.05619273051603787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07645241817919042,0.0,0.0,0.055411939394651916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06361696443269296,0.0,0.0,0.2066236285752418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07749365725012179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06930482652947369,0.11587951982497345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07426975318805995,0.061732511054650524,0.05608979700903419,0.0,0.0,0.0515694044718696,0.0,0.05818464757193127,0.060912712274017226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06707803591543215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06961912631177268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060115640097108826,0.04297365031158857,0.11566288571565618,0.11688489643169787,0.17744330353334128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07023269873788594,0.0,0.10608326544328528,0.0,0.0,0.1035127407452471,0.0,0.0,0.187673151870251

addiction,PennyFocus,2018/02/11,"How do we break the policy isolation of the big giant addiction closed meeting? ✌️✌️✌️THE ADDICTION POLICY FORUM ACCEPTING OPIOID MONEY MEANS LITTLE TO THOSE OUTSIDE THE ADVOCACY BUBBLE✌️✌️✌️

Most people outside of the “recovery bubble” care little about addiction and/or the “epidemic” until it hits them in the face. We spend most of our time preaching to the choir. Our rallies and our conferences and our events are made up of “all of us” and our “treatment allies”.   Our celebrity advocates are all people in Recovery.  All our public actions are like big giant “closed” meetings.  

On the other end of the spectrum: The AIDS movement made progress when people not directly impacted by AIDS (example—celebrities like Princess Diana) became compassionately involved.  

We separate ourselves from the rest of humanity by the way we talk (“addictive thinking”, “normies”, “earth people”, “one of us”, etc...).  We put our selves in a separate box.  Our secret knowledge and the knowledge of our secrets.  

Addiction thrives as we isolate ourselves.  Our “public health response” to this epidemic has failed miserably but nothing changes because the general public could care less....  until it hits them in the face.  Then they come into our bubble and join the isolation.  

We will never move the needle on stigma reduction, policy change, practice change etc... until the everyday person out there supports our cause.  

How do we bridge the gap?

He drinks over 100 drinks a week on average.  His tolerance for alcohol is so high he needs that much just to get a buzz.  Shockingly he is able to work (an unskilled job), drive, and maintain a a social life.  He's been drinking this way for over five years, and has been a heavy drinker since he was a teenager.  

Does anyone have any literature on the health effects of drinking at this level?  I can't find much that talks about people that drink more than 5 drinks a day.

addiction,itsnotatuma_gnaiiii,2018/02/13,"Any wisdom concerning staying sober? For pretty much the entire first half of my 20's I have used drugs and it has stripped a lot of oppurtunities away from me that I have a chance at getting back. Apart from marijuana (to help treat my bipolar and, yes, my doctors are involved) and alcohol (debatably not great for me on account that I have to take a lot of medication), I pretty much haven't touched drugs in about a year and a half. I thoroughly enjoy my sobriety, I have people that love me and I love them back, and I also believe in myself.  I also have a strong relationship with my higher power. The worst thing I can think, however, is that I'm done learning.

I've decided to move cities to get away from the drugs in my hometown, but I've realized the crux of my problem lies in the fact that I have bipolar and every so often my mind takes me to some pretty dark places. I also have a troublesome knack for finding drugs pretty much wherever I am. Any sort of wisdom or input would be appreciated.

addiction,throwaway1901110110,2018/02/13,"Is it time for rehabilitation... I don’t know who to talk to. I’m almost 25 years old, flunked out of college after thousands of dollars wasted over the course of three years. Never been able to hold a job. Lost my rent house because of that and now I’m in debt by thousands of dollars. 

The longest I’ve gone without getting drunk for the last 8 years is probably about a week. Now I’m getting drunk almost every night. And from there leads to my nastiest habit. Cocaine. Almost always in large amounts, which leads to me constantly owing money to people.
I have a bad adderall/vyvanse habit also (used to be really bad, lost 40 lbs in one semester) which eventually led to me trying meth multiple times. I’ve been abusing MDMA sporadically for the past two years, sometimes almost every week for a month. With all this stimulant use comes the crash. I’ve never been one for opiates, but benzodiazepines are what I use for dealing with the comedowns.. it’s been a never ending cycle replacing one drug with another.

I make an ass of myself all the time, always get told I’m annoying, have NEVER been able to date someone for longer than a few months. (They almost always back out as soon as they get to know who I really am)

I live back at home with my parents and I’m ashamed of it. I lie to them all the time now, I make promises I never keep and it’s tearing me up. I get told to grow the fuck up all the time. I just lost my job last week and have done nothing but get absolutely messed up for the past 9 days. Not to mention almost every paycheck went to my bar tab and drugs. My family just keeps telling me to quit being lazy and do something with my life. I don’t know why I keep fucking everything up. I feel like my life is at a dead end and everything I do just seems to dig a deeper hole. How I still haven’t been to jail is beyond me.

One of my friends passed away this past Christmas Eve from an overdose. Two other people I was becoming friends with have died in the past couple years from this shit too. I don’t want to lose someone else, and I don’t want my family to lose me. I don’t know who to talk to...",2.4544993880048978,4.338162102325583,3.751529987760101,88.3206364749082,76.81395348837209,6.479804161566707,23.64137086903305,7.3759095455046575,0.9370232558139542,1664,53,345,21,38,544,203,430,0.16,0.7929999999999999,0.047,-0.9943,5,0,5,0,0,0,48.0,0,0,3,8,16,18,4,1,22,0,28,11,2,10,9,62,66,15,2,2,7,1,1,1,2,0,4,0,2,0,15,18,3,4,6,3,6,8,13,14,0,9,15,1,40,4,68,49,6,65,0,6,0,3,16,15,4,7,43,218,55,5,0.12726267839645286,0.07539273187631225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3823055680747207,0.0,0.0,0.05088595896745203,0.15883911483968535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06672300726801082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05978373779233286,0.09785714423054337,0.10625902069541028,0.038789073770501226,0.07027581488401871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05481276441544708,0.0,0.0687628722258921,0.0,0.0,0.0704068665354231,0.0,0.04103694969350485,0.06560111667064338,0.0,0.0,0.06603928399489987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0651169523288821,0.0,0.0,0.14758430371354095,0.0,0.0531558189050093,0.0,0.11271695949507947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16083644301498534,0.0,0.11437548939785795,0.0,0.1199719271038456,0.0,0.03217391700644298,0.04545824143735571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09832282964037634,0.11765229549404135,0.1994684906663984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06382742139809544,0.0,0.0,0.0734220221276165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12628857135506188,0.16967537388844472,0.0,0.0,0.13988047968024808,0.1037360684165291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08988939335594434,0.031087058189161,0.0,0.05618763829220996,0.0,0.0,0.14237438459320695,0.20838337022828676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08494882604052541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1015798557392749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2453820576865183,0.0,0.0,0.059713701332403835,0.0,0.06105598610740664,0.0,0.06677038654516226,0.0,0.17247296893088115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0706550719183315,0.0,0.24297325320326044,0.08822791733451851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06860534590255941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06767976177367449,0.0,0.0,0.08152773052788959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05792758138009956,0.0,0.0,0.06531665528006471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10782925442231356,0.048986513660758055,0.06293302151617625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05081606967965532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1022889202704894,0.05561659512405488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1855197279808033,0.0,0.0,0.1216049429300802,0.0,0.043201502444791914,0.0,0.1243171448029188,0.0,0.0,0.16487114029074107,0.0,0.0,0.07506282498052927,0.0,0.15312366636481392,0.0,0.0,0.05898688893186384,0.05741738640471339,0.0,0.0,0.06133834029745575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20488248104126705
addiction,TheDeletedAccount,2018/02/14,"Android Parental Controls loophole I have the LG V20 with android software. I make a password for the parental controls, but then can just go to data in the app settings, delete the data, and the password is gone. It does not ask for the password to the parental controls. No password needed.

This is my phone and I am putting on parental controls so I am not tempted to download apps like Instagram and snapchat. I got a sexting/M addiction. 

I have willpower but its comforting and helps to know that even if I wanted to, I cannot get access to social media on my cell phone.

Anyone know how to fix this loophole or have any tips on how to wall downloading apps off?

TL;DR: I need to be steered away from triggers from social media and blocked from downloading apps on an android phone.

addiction,whywhywhywhyyyyyyy,2018/02/14,"How long does it usually take to get your life back to normal after heroin addiction? I know it isn't something that happens overnight, but I feel like i'm still struggling with adapting to normal human life. I last used in october, being clean 8 months prior to that.

It seems like it's going so slowly. It's already February and I haven't made any art or music since I quit. I haven't been interested in doing anything, or seeing anyone. 

The only good thing I can say is that I've managed to wake up around the same time and take better care of myself, my apartment and my cat. But I still wake up every day in pain, wondering why I still get up every day. I can't hold down a job, and the things I used to love no longer appeal to me.

Is this going to last forever? I feel like I broke my brain. :-  (",2.303766233766233,3.960923000000001,3.881580086580087,88.22522727272728,76.57575757575758,6.411255411255411,21.482683982683984,7.1686216300943375,0.5978138528138528,625,16,130,7,14,208,103,165,0.109,0.716,0.175,0.9303,1,0,1,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,0,2,7,11,0,1,4,0,10,8,3,4,0,23,29,10,0,2,4,0,2,3,0,0,4,1,1,1,11,6,0,1,5,1,0,2,5,3,0,0,2,4,19,8,19,26,1,25,0,1,1,1,4,9,0,4,17,79,30,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14150738457094872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14324382944470065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08827233441954073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09076317096822907,0.0,0.10681903964117544,0.11555460282190935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09981257900503436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11480260245578272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14490610232937468,0.0,0.0,0.13234557302991154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16742788952674634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1135938520707916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21873381927027846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13126733498542756,0.18546645114459828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1356362524862419,0.0,0.14754315338886204,0.10887487144139064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11478676117290627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1288121383975119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07133782382027185,0.21161795811459413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18337122438229544,0.19024954034401034,0.0,0.0,0.11487396911275513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11715472174864587,0.12282530191831627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10360967976349122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2543640720061638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09872309216281,0.13812242803653269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13806435129890732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1032267110702062,0.0,0.0,0.10343834532751278,0.11817024374735607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10737662516412846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09993077773507104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3109890244299294,0.0,0.0,0.1357011125359842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19519547966713546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1724742925043603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07569075370706267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22422091366370028,0.14296265138741907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1171294638086174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14076875597938068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,ne0technic,2018/02/14,"Partner with caffeine addiction I'm not sure what to do any more. In the past before we ever met, he had a drug addiction which eventually moved to alcohol, then cigarettes and now energy drink. When he was working crazy hours, he needed them to function in his day to day job and now that he's without work, he's still downing an awful amount of caffeine to avoid smoking, or worse. It keeps him awake all night and then he'll sleep throughout the day and it's been impacting me severely since I'll be worrying and having trouble sleeping, and he gets depressed over his inability to quit. Any advice would be really helpful right now because at the time of typing this, I'm walking in the blazing sun to move house on a day he said he'd be able to help me. I could've woken him up but I'd feel awful for disrupting his sleep, considering it's so hard for him to get to sleep unless he outright crashes.

addiction,JibbingJaw,2018/02/15,"23 year old male in need of anyone's advice I'm 23 year old male, as you would guessed by the title and I want anyone's experience/advice on my current addiction. I'm at point in my life where I'm  towards the end of completing my engineering apprenticeship but the last 6 years I've done all sorts of drugs from lsd to weed and everything in between thinking that I was jack the lad for doing them.

The last six months I've stopped taking everything expect cocaine, I went from smoking weed everyday to stopping completely with absolute ease but with cocaine it's a different story.

I went through a stage last summer of doing coke everyday I've stopped when I wanted to easily but I can't seem to kick it on the weekend, The current place I work I love the job and my work mates but there bringing in drug testing in six weeks and even when I tell my self I won't do cocaine I end up doing it I need to stop and I don't know how.

I know there's people in far worse situations than me, I feel like I'm verge off either doing really good for myself or ruining it all because of my greed.",3.0434722222222206,4.6060693392857175,4.592797619047619,84.29942460317463,74.35714285714286,7.8349206349206355,26.73015873015873,8.515128840125781,1.856827182539684,868,32,177,16,18,291,125,224,0.09,0.813,0.097,0.5625,5,0,5,0,0,0,10.0,0,1,1,2,7,5,1,0,10,0,11,6,0,1,2,33,30,14,0,6,6,0,1,1,1,2,4,0,0,3,5,7,1,4,5,1,1,3,3,2,0,2,4,1,25,3,33,24,3,45,0,1,0,1,8,17,0,4,25,106,30,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12379044693396532,0.0,0.22192699673313016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15879897057482106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0692213669835218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2381180818788337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11863959424826058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11620500351915974,0.0,0.0,0.2633728072190198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2011499956054464,0.0,0.0,0.07500124046374929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20410973905620866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057416233488258014,0.08112288608844698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09524357358785296,0.0,0.0,0.12509235709243605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1126846646985618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12481244170801965,0.2776846066410533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08020643548016289,0.055476670468643775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10248677416843864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09063759183660823,0.0,0.0,0.16839746726350424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2383113068396714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07872393499440877,0.0,0.11863959424826058,0.0,0.10734508278144428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07274549770890024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10337515128368792,0.11846142044316048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12763927404195002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3797443798611225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08537835583898261,0.0,0.09925106137450326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07276071566156876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13395399399169367,0.0,0.09108604110196547,0.0,0.0,0.21053109492261154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16533709608998512,0.0,0.11572106428333515,0.08066539001990126,0.0,0.0,0.2193748501327321

addiction,Phonethrowawaypls,2018/02/15,"Help, phone addiction Hello, 

I love my family very much. I do enjoy spending time with my family. I just find that I do so much on my phone and any time I have a spare thought or second I seem to pick it up then I am back on it. 

I do a lot of my work from my phone. My work can also have emergencies well into the evening which require my attention. When I get home it isn't just work distractions, typically I will get on Facebook a bit, get on Reddit a bit, check the news, check bank and bills, I plan vacations, I look at personal emails, and I do it all from my phone. 

I know it seems simple. Just put it down. It even seems silly to many, I get it. I just seem to not be able to do it. What things can I do to stop This? I don't even do anything that useful most of the time, it's just what I do as filler. 

My family is just wanting my undivided attention for a few hours in the evening and I feel i should be able to provide that

Please help!!

addiction,ChachiBurger,2018/02/15,"Tired of fucking up Hello all,
I stumbled across this subreddit after a two and a half day crack bender.
Looking for help and support of any kind.
Im 31 years old and I've been addicted to crack cocaine for 13 years. The longest I've had clean was nine months, about a year into my addiction. Destroyed my college career in architectural Engineering and shattered my family and social life.
The most recent clean time I had was 8 months, 2 years ago, but  5 months of that was spent in county jail, for possession violation charge.
Been to jail 3 times, split between three different jails.
All were for possession.
Was arrested twice at the same spot.
Guess where I went to cop my last bender?
Same fucking spot.
Even on the way home I told myself that I'm a fucking idiot.
And that's what I feel like, a fucking idiot.
By God's grace I haven't lived on the street or haven't caused any serious health problems that I know of due to addiction.
I want to stop. I've been wanting to stop for the last 8 years. 
Usually I binge on the weekends because my money is gone during the week. The past few months have seen at least $700 to 900 dollars pass thru my hands to drug dealers. In one fucking day!
I've tried NA, I can't open up.
I went to meeting last year every week and still was fucking using. Not court mandated, on my own will, even had to take 2 trains to get there. I don't think I ever said a word in that room.
My war stories are the same as everyone elses, so no need to dive into them.
My situation is I am an addict and I want to stop.
I have a great job as a cook, a wonderful loving girlfriend who is a drug counselor ( she know my history, doesn't know that I use every weekend, and the two times that I've been caught up in my lies they were ""relapses""), and a roof over my head.
Reading some of these posts gave me enough confidence to share my addiction.
I want some tips on how to stay clean. I've tried the exercise, I'm an avid runner when not completely blown out of my mind. It just doesn't work. Nothing seems to work. I'll go through the week or sometimes two if rent is due absolutely no fine. No cravings no thoughts. I work hard, I stay busy. But as soon as that money hits my pocket it a fucking huge monkey on my back.
Money is a huge trigger for me. I've tried handed my finances off to my girlfriend, and she was willing to help, but she was also resistant because she said it's not really helping because what's going to happen when Im forced to handle my money again. 
I think a huge part of the problem is that I love alone and there is no one to hold me accountable for anything. I've lived with others before but the drugs always find a way.
Ruined a lot of great relationships, but I think i found my wife this time.
We're moving in together in a month and I am very excited to be with her and I'm elated that someone will be there to hold me accountable.
But I know that addiction always finds a way, so I'm petrified of ruining this.
I need help.
I've thought about rehab but I've also worked in a mental hospital/county crisis center/ detox rehabilitation center for five years. I used the whole time, shit I was smoking blunts on my break. I was a psychiatric tech, preaching to addicts while high. 
So I know what rehab entails, and I know that most of time it doesn't work unless you are fully committed to staying clean.
I don't know if there is something wrong with me or if I just like getting high.
Reading some posts last night made we ponder about seeing a psychologist, maybe they'll have some insight for me.
But in the meantime I need help. I have a little less then 24 hours clean and I want this time to last 
Any tips on how you guys were able to break the 30 day plain would be appreciated, also any motivation would help too.
I just want to use my full potential in life. I want to be a productive member of society no held back by the damn chains.

addiction,boleyn93,2018/02/16,"Rehab experiences I’m addicted to cocaine and just can’t get better alone, it’s destroying me. In 2.5 years I’ve become a slave to it and can’t let go. I feel like rehab is my only option at this point. I’m just really apprehensive, I find it difficult to be in an environment where I’m totally controlled. But I also know nothing I’ve tried worked, so I have to give it a go.

I’m from the UK, so stories about experiences with those rehabs would be great. Of course even if you’re not from the UK I’d still like to hear about it.

Did you enjoy the time there or did you resent the staff for being controlling? Did it actually work or did you relapse? Did you hate that you were putting your life on hold but eventually were happy with your decision?",1.5496428571428569,3.8046181688311727,3.718295454545455,85.5474431818182,81.59740259740259,7.226623376623378,21.313311688311693,8.278499904357787,1.2507285714285716,594,18,124,13,16,203,99,154,0.061,0.835,0.104,0.8146,0,1,1,0,0,0,15.0,0,7,0,5,11,11,3,1,7,0,16,5,0,2,1,22,28,10,0,2,8,0,1,2,0,1,5,1,0,0,9,4,0,3,4,0,0,3,3,5,0,0,7,2,13,6,17,16,1,12,0,0,0,0,9,6,0,4,5,80,22,3,0.0,0.0,0.16512968401285608,0.18446961034019213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17525597654593386,0.0,0.1353213821612943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1868849599297008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14965714619960513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3795786051608271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11176508321970316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3310499879797309,0.0,0.0,0.0855603197266942,0.12088741544321566,0.0,0.0,0.15465968190432164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08840798916609223,0.16232669630371666,0.1923378634728455,0.0,0.0,0.18656042136013035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18013279064869228,0.0,0.16706503635229716,0.0,0.0,0.19071789603444428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09299628144879504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17303406787489692,0.11952174231743412,0.1653400571335048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16236660558091778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12869583024284947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15996311575796962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17010807371139547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10840362846030084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1351355250955177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09867077880799033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11488605385255853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2463814490206032,0.0,0.0,0.12020566557004635,0.0,0.0,0.10896907939918377

I joined twitter 1 year ago and I was spending my whole life there. Few weeks ago I changed my password and email to some copy pasted ""blablabla"" so I can't login again. So I don't have an account anymore.

But my problem is that I'm still checking twitter. I type twitter.com/myfavoriteaccounts and sit there for hours. What else can I honestly do?

addiction,Tiaman77,2018/02/16,Saw a few posts on here saw that I'm not alone with phenibut tianeptine addiction how can doctor help me? Hello I just want to say that on February 28th I will finally have first meting with my new family doctor and just wanted advice what I should mention or what details should I share so doctor can help me. I have used and abused phenibut since 2014 on and off every 1 to 3 months and would binge it from 4 to 10 grams at a time 3 to 4 days at a time. In 2016 I also used memantine in high doses and then dusvovered tianeptine sodium which is the hardest of all to get rid off. My tolerance skyrocketed from 100 mg to about 3 grams for a week at a time. I would quit for 1 to 2 months and then crave more of it. I ended up in ER about about a month ago when I combined phenibut with tianeptine and was confused at work and had to be sent to hospital. I quit for a month and bought 5 gram jar again 3 weeks ago and finished it within 3 days i want to beat this but it seems that when I am off these substances I experience no zest in life and have this empty or hollow feeling like nothing can bring joy. Please can anyone help or what should I say more to the doctor to help me,6.557537112010799,4.852857408906882,6.578390688259107,84.55992071524969,66.00404858299595,9.690823211875845,30.29993252361673,8.07648339933343,1.7649139001349523,928,24,209,9,12,296,134,247,0.056,0.835,0.109,0.8132,0,1,0,0,1,0,8.0,0,0,0,5,12,4,0,1,9,0,18,7,0,3,1,36,32,22,0,8,7,0,1,1,0,6,7,2,0,0,14,14,0,0,2,0,1,2,2,1,1,1,6,5,19,3,41,19,4,43,0,0,2,0,10,17,0,5,24,134,33,5,0.0,0.13272085265424574,0.0,0.12211416707437348,0.0,0.10946091168020353,0.19859116437760527,0.0,0.0,0.11601497699943783,0.0,0.08957929622936411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07832431542296821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14448233451963782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4586132145236542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09921308460690824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09437846029086397,0.0,0.0,0.10957331526741516,0.10559888243549778,0.0,0.05663874477088283,0.08002437918851983,0.0,0.12270824653136067,0.0,0.09528090288249903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05852382915445119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30032832881544586,0.11835124105301208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07912033848532153,0.05472544589770893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35764097495047004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10818592170656896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10748254286785984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12296012445457034,0.0,0.0,0.10728053337819572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2382859850409675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17815951980718214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10197532045367612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09266093910880377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19595260075353824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19349202301855672,0.0,0.0,0.1982101301965627,0.0,0.1797052408608243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08154911091925504,0.0,0.0,0.15914615639548188,0.0,0.0,0.0

""i have a addictive personality."" there have been sever huge studies trying to isolate a gene that creates the 'addictive personality"". how ever you can learn and pick up 100's of addictive habits in your lifetime. making the battle of sobriety so much more difficult. if addiction where anything other then mental......its not, you can die if you build up and addiction and quit cold turkey. (only some substances.) is death a side effect or an outcome of addiction? idk if it really matters???? people die all the time from drugs. we need a better system to revert 100's of decisions created by people who have found themselves addicted to a substance. we dont need another pointless debate trying to see whos feelings are more important? there is a serious fucking problem that has effected all of us. WHO DO YOU KNOW THAT HAD A DRUG RELATED DEATH? now tell me why its important that you convince anyone its a choice or disease? the real battle is how you and I are prevent addiction/ death",3.4576816745655603,6.415350018957351,5.0074703791469215,74.82046307266984,79.61611374407583,8.445576619273302,29.644747235387047,9.075114841892004,3.4213173775671404,918,44,146,26,24,307,126,211,0.13,0.768,0.102,-0.8506,0,0,2,0,0,0,34.0,3,10,0,5,8,8,3,0,16,0,19,13,0,8,3,36,28,14,5,6,7,0,1,0,0,0,12,0,0,2,11,6,0,1,7,0,0,1,3,6,0,0,4,3,16,2,20,23,6,15,0,0,1,1,19,9,1,8,4,108,27,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8537363385731916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0821188786806578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0547588505678711,0.0,0.0644456090186858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06926221820609861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.162554782003499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1835664501619782,0.0,0.1816383587619272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07083934245601603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03959782533063892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08586707200325068,0.0,0.07239987356511215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04303923268369257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052275089398066465,0.07939793140805865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07892192066254587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05756967568628803,0.11613742472650895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05956119639356576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10858589767601803,0.13676123066372295,0.0,0.0,0.07403188227162076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07493575844676682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08329639765641647,0.0,0.08913828320361973,0.05016984460425325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06240598289321354,0.0,0.0,0.08847233634193769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06844973892256169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045665423843173264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10633989933444954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09420189452312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07066605030840176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,Somevelvetmorning22,2018/02/16,Help I need some help. My brother is a pain killer addicts amongst other things. He is clearly an addict. If nothing changes he will die. This week he either overdosed or had a major withdrawal reaction. He blatantly lies and says he doesn't have a problem. He had to be taken by ambulance and nearly died on Monday. I'm going to visit him butI al not sure how to help him when he won't admit to the problem. He was forced into a in patient treatment program this week but is free to go in 2 days. What can I possibly say it do to help him? ,2.068918918918918,3.940675036036037,3.940801801801804,86.57931081081081,77.91891891891892,6.241801801801803,26.41531531531532,7.1686216300943375,1.3643434234234233,423,17,84,5,10,143,80,111,0.135,0.7,0.16399999999999998,0.5394,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,0,2,5,0,0,6,0,13,3,0,1,3,17,19,7,2,4,5,1,0,0,0,2,3,2,0,0,6,3,0,0,1,0,1,3,3,3,0,0,4,2,6,3,12,12,3,13,0,0,0,0,20,5,0,3,5,53,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37927348507705416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18402143677686925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1121866525772496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3610758726133474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1977253913451964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4663937635828402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12898550709904225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16691461603144306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18510049778517065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19610824504942895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3329030870408591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2766721650558788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16395062895610096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11556804297292758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2790725868292786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,HeadTheory,2018/02/16,"Television Project Hello, I am an assistant for a television writer based in Los Angeles who is interested in having a conversation with a recovering addict for a project they are doing. They are interested in getting a more personal, more realistic account of what living as a recovering addict is like so that they can avoid the many cliches of Hollywood and television's portrayal of addicts. It would of course be kept completely anonymous. No names or likeness of would ever be used in a script or a show/film. My boss completely understands the complexity of this request. He just wants to have a conversation with a real person, so that he can ensure that the characters and the situations he is writing are realistic and in no way demean addicts or portray them in a stereotypical and/or negative light.   

Thank you all for your help with this, if it's at all possible, in pointing me in the right direction. I of course completely understand if it is not.

addiction,KeepsMakingMistakes,2018/02/17,"Ephedra and kratom Appreciate any accurate advice that can be offered for quitting daily ephedra / kratom use. I’m very familiar with kratom withdrawal, but not so much ephedra withdrawal. This is my first ephedra use period. No stimulant use before that except coffee. Kratom has some stimulant activity, but it’s not very strong compared to even coffee. Not sure it really makes a difference in your responses, but the ephedra is in the form of 25 mg yellow bullet capsules.

I’ve been combining ephedra in the form of 25-50 mg of ephedra combined with 12-14 g of kratom to create a stronger kratom related euphoria. Usually one dose of 50 mg a day and 2 doses of 25 mg a day. I’ve been using kratom for 5 years at 45 g a day for last 6 months. I’ve been using ephedra for 75-100 mg a day for last 3 weeks, combined with the kratom and a big mug of coffee. Coffee is always necessary when taking kratom for a decent reaction; otherwise, kratom use does little due to tolerance levels (been using the store low quality stuff during this time). Combining coffee with ephedra is probably not advised, but no real problems yet, except for a few side effects described below. 

I have read online be the dangers of ephedra withdrawal, but am wondering if this has been enough time to become physically dependent on it and is it potentially dangerous to quit at home. I’ve withdrawn from kratom enough times to know it is not so dangerous to quit at home, just hard psychologically and physically. 

Can anyone give me their thoughts on ephedra quit? I’ve noticed that sometimes during ephedra doses, I get a sharp headache on right side, just for a few moments. I’ve also been getting quite sleepy on some days in the afternoon between lunch and dinner doses. Paranoia and anxiety has been increasing, but I don’t know if this can be attributed to ephedra because kratom abuse eventually leads to the same issues. I’ve been able to sleep ok by taking some sleep aids and clonidine before bed.

I want to stop using it *immediately* if it is not going to be life threatening. I am afraid of permanent damage caused by ephedra. If I can quit at home and tapering is recommended, what is a good way to taper off 100 mg of daily ephedra use. Maybe drop 25 mg every few days? I have little idea how to taper it.  I want to quit at home because going into rehab is not something I can do at this time. Been in rehab 3 x before in last 2 years and cannot afford to lose my job.

addiction,underscore_frosty,2018/02/17,"Rehab for RC benzo addiction, any experiences? So, after talking with my psychiatrist today about my research chemical benzodiazepine addiction (addicted to clonazolam specifically), he suggested I should go to an intensive inpatient program for detox and rehab. Has anyone here been to rehab for using RC benzos, or even just benzos themselves? What was the experience like? More specifically, what was the detox period like? Also for those that were employed when they went to rehab, what did your employer think? What I'm afraid of the most is losing my job to go to rehab, I literally cannot afford to lose my job and look for another. I want to go to rehab, I want off this stuff, but the potential repercussions have me apprehensive about doing so. 

I've come off of traditional benzos before, but it took a grueling 6 months to do so. This inpatient program my psychiatrist is suggesting is only 28 days. I'm afraid of ending up like so many of the horror stories of people that came off benzos too quickly.

On a related note, I finally told my family about my addiction. It went better than expected and they're supportive of me, maybe not my decisions, but definitely me, the person. It felt good to finally get it off my chest and to stop hiding it from them.",7.549242236024845,8.32070466956522,8.619751552795035,62.52434782608697,63.17391304347826,12.658385093167706,34.254658385093165,12.161744961471696,4.853683229813665,1014,41,160,35,14,347,134,230,0.052000000000000005,0.841,0.106,0.8779,5,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,0,1,2,3,14,11,0,3,9,0,14,13,1,1,0,23,33,14,0,4,6,0,1,3,0,1,12,0,0,1,15,7,0,1,3,0,0,8,2,5,0,0,11,2,20,6,36,21,2,25,0,2,1,0,9,6,0,2,14,116,35,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5193801331371466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09525042817841642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08099735738554541,0.12489486570734958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08328291128473432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1013519263120502,0.0,0.0,0.10534112959680923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1362275403903515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10260078391277737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07681464806318444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10549411736293283,0.0,0.0,0.0786695484634063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23302047762078054,0.11228419054989512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11436212283479305,0.26095344605539456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06222888569395425,0.0,0.20307504503102586,0.09990193337961016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23639213527063965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.174570097335823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000205156595562,0.2665022212279738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12075656828210606,0.11965974848668336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0950706732249698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0905868144385125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08257431985096389,0.10400029696058627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09957941598855972,0.0,0.0,0.136349882532024,0.0,0.13516206822675444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0957343012824415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07631943967295507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11290022428739566,0.11381256360041055,0.13233309770491433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10287085753853084,0.0,0.0,0.14050567906659908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22082816327649354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,FeatheredDrake,2018/02/17,"What happens to celebrities after they talk about their drug habits openly? This is a question I've always had but I still don't know the answer. I was randomly watching an interview of one of my favorite musicians, and he was talking about his heroin addiction. This is not the first time I hear a famous person talk about their drug use, and I've been wondering...what happens to them after they admit they've been doing drugs? I've always imagined that they are being charged for drug possession and the police is going to search their house for any drug supplies that they might be hiding and confiscate everything they find. Is this true? Or does no one care?

Hi all, made a post last night and someone gave me some insight into what i asked, and i thank them.

I am here again because I would like to fix whats left of me. Now we are not going to pour  this story out as its not worth the text wall. I have an addictive personality, switching from one thing to the next. I/we have planted Ideas in are mind via confirmation bias that cause us to go into the patterns of self destruction.


Due to my age, I dont have excuses, and pity is for those that deserve it, So I am just wondering where can one start to derail an addictive personality.",4.457613636363637,5.046356244047622,5.537792207792208,82.56175324675327,69.89285714285714,8.728138528138528,27.177489177489186,8.841846274778883,1.8035404761904763,651,20,138,11,11,216,107,168,0.109,0.8420000000000001,0.049,-0.8442,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,7,0,1,0,8,7,1,0,11,0,16,4,0,3,1,30,25,7,0,3,4,0,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,4,10,12,0,0,4,0,1,3,4,4,0,3,2,0,18,3,21,21,3,24,0,3,0,0,16,8,0,3,12,95,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4526348430552206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12938690592365895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08436839125226935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14217666961151698,0.2928212927491169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16220576073508616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1573137502812472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14816188151737522,0.15623867211755113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07606195437949087,0.11281585710089535,0.0,0.0,0.15037385117092728,0.0,0.09775721319041768,0.13523215860749893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13095903422418928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13974626233248313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1471917772637832,0.12988061913880306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2813537197864311,0.10526072888357577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13212008239340134,0.09595031184673927,0.3625410760948069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13255057009873178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14438315658555714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11726731062679732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09796143506438673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12742168979594545,0.0,0.0,0.09194793915464038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16648020322151402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15009073899334066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1966331923880097,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,aman3vedi,2018/02/19,"Struggling with caffeine addiction I am a musician and writer and over the years I have developed a dependency on caffeine, very specifically - Red Bull, when composing music or writing.  

I want to kick this habit but somehow my brain has so gravely associated Red Bull with productivity, that I get into a panic state by even the thought of bringing a compulsion into my life; especially one which could hamper with my creativity. 

Psychologically speaking, my creative flow is directly associated with freedom and peace of mind: meaning I can only be optimistic and enthusiastic towards doing something if I have almost no restrictions in my life (sleep routine, responsibilities, eating well and etc). 

The problem occurs when I try to balance the two things, being optimistic and disciplined. I want to live a healthy and creative life but don't want either to be exclusive and this creates a major hinderance in my overall productivity because I can either be A or I can either be B.

addiction,Gutterprincess5,2018/02/19,"I was 8 when I started opiates.How old did you start your addiction and how did it progress? I know this sounds like bullshit but most of my immediate family are addicts. I stayed with grandma who was an opiate addict. She would snort, parachute, filter, pop her hydros/oxys/percs/etc etc in front of us and would nod off frequently. One day when I was 8 I stole some of her pills she had out. But I was too scared to swallow them at the time so I took a hammer (lmfao) and smushed them in the garage to snort. It was very unhygenic and I ended not really getting high but sick. I kept using her pills to high off of anyways because I wanted the same happy effect she got. Sometimes if she left a pile of crushed pills behind I'd finish it. By middle school I knew how to filter my pills. I also parachuted them alot. By the time I was a freshman I was sipping cough syrup (and I got the codeine or codeine/prometh from family that had a script for it so it was real lean). I tried really hard not to do anything worse than morphine but at 18 I finally caved and started smoking tar. I quit a couple months ago when I wanted to start snorting China bc smoking h wasnt getting me high no more (Im 20 btw).

SOOOooooo.. What age y'all started your addictions? And how did it progress? Etc etc. I struggled with other substances but opiates are especially a weakness for me.",2.7696978021978005,4.708300040293043,3.7151144688644715,88.6871771978022,76.06959706959707,6.161721611721612,26.39331501831502,6.996647511020387,1.1791710622710618,1073,41,215,11,24,344,158,273,0.118,0.835,0.047,-0.9626,0,0,4,0,0,0,34.0,1,4,3,4,11,5,0,2,13,0,19,12,0,5,0,36,35,23,0,5,9,0,1,1,0,2,11,1,0,0,11,10,1,1,3,0,0,2,4,3,0,1,19,5,40,2,27,14,8,34,0,0,0,0,16,12,0,5,20,146,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4328414208811321,0.0,0.0,0.08798987437641881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07937987620599903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816842616299342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0605092629976219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10983164045722277,0.0,0.06401585137907713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08791676989677093,0.0,0.44281398068474204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1871509727818982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1087367933118642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10372071469475418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15877795967007838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10566636546241412,0.08891935652067318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31462761795626376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10722011591245084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05455186158403768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10784857662225658,0.0,0.0,0.04849445467349224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07923007188254462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10415889030551324,0.0,0.0672625769486407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1055774759925841,0.0,0.11298201626640668,0.1271797031632904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.099378691907097,0.10045855808988458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0981727682565414,0.0,0.35129117374132673,0.10580020561654624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10377031301814556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11576107311100298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11028386028980386,0.06739245924743667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11940010057211055,0.08573059557609329,0.0,0.08190163910635871,0.11709473252608207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10115657373180616,0.14102591474918075,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,Glaswell,2018/02/19,"Brother Asked for money, any advice? This is tough and I wasn’t sure who to ask.  My brother was recently arrested for crystal meth and given parole so I am told. He keeps getting robbed, losing money, in wrecks, so forth and so on.  I don’t live in the same city.

After 3yrs of not being in touch with him he contacted me and asked for money. He says he has a job lined up. I’ve heard this before.

I am glad to know that he’s still alive having not gotten so much as a text or online message in such a long time.  

I made a decision a long time ago that I could not get emotionally invested in his challenges. I do want him to get better, but I don’t think money will ultimately help.

I sent him a little money, enough for some food and gas.  Should that be the end of it? 
I definitely can’t afford a rehab center nor do I think he wants to go into one.",1.4512918994413404,3.135875480446927,3.6055272346368703,89.138905377095,79.11173184357541,6.262709497206704,19.008729050279328,7.1686216300943375,0.24415335195530696,657,14,144,8,16,225,113,179,0.031,0.866,0.103,0.8767,2,0,1,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,0,3,6,6,0,0,9,0,17,2,0,1,1,25,36,13,0,4,5,2,1,0,0,2,1,2,0,0,7,7,1,1,4,0,6,2,8,2,0,1,8,3,17,4,21,23,4,21,0,1,0,0,23,10,0,2,9,93,24,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15728041573787313,0.1426742223124885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10945286823261756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4514051336727554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1369582835024007,0.0,0.0,0.1423489500077474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12850706224685995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1810493181804768,0.1425556845278259,0.16630642439696894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19462377763848054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2522723053927124,0.0,0.09147272150832067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10788272198927967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15972000857908114,0.14306151845906231,0.0,0.0,0.08845500101415041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16131617132657036,0.14212355043337618,0.2848748815205873,0.0,0.18006409989970126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1522966586858606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11831822743309232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.109065229662984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15892066656681467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12799547762217828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12853646213750464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15169533990131898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20626306446886328,0.0,0.0,0.18770479213910296,0.0,0.0,0.1537965179243639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18986730028250745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,AnonymousSmoker,2018/02/20,"Help me with my weed problem Dear readers,

Lately I've been really struggling with a ongoing weed problem and hopefully you can help me with it with viewing it from a different perpective. Hopefully someone could advise me on this matter. This is quite emotionly loaded for I've never shared this struggle with anyone yet. Sorry for potential grammar or spelling mistakes, English is not my first language.

I'm 17 years and I live in the Netherlands, in Amsterdam. At the moment I'm in highschool and this year I'm graduading. I smoke weed (almost) everyday and I'm struggling to recognize it as a problem. Smoking weed at a age where your brain is still developing is bad ofcourse but I'm more worried about the social drawbacks of smoking weed. I have a hard time as accepting it as a problem in my life because I have a well paying job and a vivid social life and I'm oing great in school. Next year I even will be attending one of the best Lawschools in Europe. From my perpective it doesn't seem like a problem because of my bright looking future. My parents see it as a problem though. They know that I smoke weed but allow it if I smoke 1-2 times a week. 
Alot of my social contacts smoke weed with me but sometimes I even resort to smoking alone. I'm apart of different friendgroups and my friends that I keep in high regard keep telling me that I should lessen my smoking habits. But I'm afraid of losing contact with these the friends I smoke weed with if I start smoking less. I sometimes feel like that I'm dependent of this THC-plant. 

I was wondering if I should change my smoking habits and I hope that someone could advise me on this matter from a different perpective. If you read this to the end, thank you for taking the time for reading.

addiction,canadaisok,2018/02/20,"How can I turn knowledge into action? I need help but stuck. Hi everyone, my first ever post on here. 

I've been suffering from mood issues since I can remember, I had a difficult upbringing like many others, diagnosed with adult ADHD which explained a lot. Started using marijuana and booze when I was a teen, lead to the piece of shit love of my life, 'dancing powder' 'white liquor' 'rich people crack'

I went to rehab for a short stint a couple years ago, managed to not do it for 9 months but relapsed on alcohol after 5. I was using it 1/4 the amount then (once a weekend to four times a week)
as now (functioning, mostly working somehow, keeping up a brave front). I keep trying to go back to AA but something stops me every time. I studied psych and myself and many friends have  gone through recovery programs and learnt a lot about addiction, but knowledge is shit without action and all my friends/fellow addicts i was close to that tried to think their way out of their addictions are dead...

18 of us were in my section of the treatment center that year... 11 left

I don't want to join them,

I have a girlfriend who loves me, a great job, lots to live for but once I set my mind to using it all slips away and I get pure tunnel vision. Nothing can stop me it seems. 

It is ruining my life. I thought I'd see if anyone has suggestions about going back into Recovery after a lengthly relapse, as I don't think i'll have my sanity or the love of my life every day.

I play the tape through again and again when I'm craving and no matter how many times i try to remember the  come-down instead of the high I just submit. 

I don't want to be dead, alone, insane, or all of the above.

If anyone has any tips on AA alternatives or ways to get around the mental block or anxiety keeping me from starting up again... Id love to hear them.

I. Need. Help.
I. Am. Not. Okay.

addiction,joe123181,2018/02/20,"Having a horrible night I’ve been trying to get better but i’m only getting worse. I’m only 20 but i still have no idea what i wanna do with my life. I know I need to stop doing drugs but it’s so hard to stop. i pushed everyone away and have no one close now and my mom, who i live with, knows about my drug use but doesn’t help me in quitting. I know it’s up to me to stop, but i wish she’d help me take the first step. I’m scared of what the future holds because no one supports me in helping me stop and it’s so hard doing it by myself. I used to have such a bright future and now i’m 20 and running out of time. subconsciously, I won’t let anyone get close to me, but i want steady friendships and a healthy relationship once again. I don’t know what to do.",-0.08352941176470452,1.647009705882354,2.12294117647059,97.65323529411766,84.29411764705883,4.941176470588236,17.058823529411768,5.900188976854957,-0.659764705882353,590,12,147,4,17,199,90,170,0.185,0.649,0.166,-0.3713,0,0,2,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,3,9,4,0,1,5,0,14,3,0,2,0,33,32,14,0,4,6,1,2,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,8,11,0,5,5,0,0,3,6,1,0,3,1,3,23,3,20,28,0,23,0,0,1,0,7,7,0,0,13,94,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09085915589049676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12208571113481778,0.0,0.0,0.07921203709246627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11492400983672035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3013852150528356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12416609000509644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.110529435994912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20366953816593866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2328067809132171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26129412972347243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14668981246836624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2856530632956285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13287550527002406,0.09178257262416643,0.0,0.0,0.114742035730829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15218765262069006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09635107629649572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12194268810996944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13838503731254947,0.17610545811473505,0.19765498990669844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13821035871453632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13951013524644598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13009559593966838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10377263505114613,0.4345526130735831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1474577585972032,0.0,0.0,0.09770095252844707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0757707990716467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0882227566029069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22445803436738676,0.0,0.0,0.07664373879874366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14942801896953695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13242300225844014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,yaboyassman,2018/02/21,"i’ve been clean off and on for a year, but i’m having a hard time lately i don’t know where else to talk about this, my only friend is probably getting fed up with my self destructive behavior. 
as i said in the title, i’ve been clean off and on for almost a year, it was mostly alcohol where i was drinking to a point of blackout every other day, then i started to do inhalants and i couldnt function without them, but my i started to take whatever people offered me without even knowing what it was. the past few months i’ve been struggling with staying sober, i just miss the feeling of avoiding my issues, not being able to focus on the shit happening all i focused on was what my next drink would be.
does anybody else struggle with these feelings? i don’t have much of a support system and the people who say they support me tend to just call me an idiot or make my past addictions the butt of the joke.",6.174836956521737,5.567348548913047,6.5925217391304365,80.56986956521742,66.22826086956522,8.881739130434784,33.61739130434783,7.908726449838941,2.4055017391304347,719,28,141,7,10,234,114,184,0.116,0.733,0.151,0.7935,0,1,3,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,2,0,6,11,3,3,13,0,17,7,2,1,1,26,34,9,0,2,8,0,3,0,1,1,2,2,2,1,8,7,4,1,4,3,0,0,6,7,0,0,9,6,20,4,27,21,4,25,0,1,0,1,10,11,2,3,12,103,28,0,0.13349895106786042,0.0,0.0,0.1455335618492415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14266977906801614,0.13367991561093387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13631735511781642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08609577934610169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11682583171304035,0.0,0.0,0.26155629693005306,0.0,0.0,0.22304248681189714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08817479812172813,0.0,0.11247862403721924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13500216170915513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10314095843656257,0.0,0.0697476919669475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11805268154225253,0.0,0.11958883829050145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13933822079847655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14673506441541914,0.0,0.15059263160956193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08911158647414086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10655758908808062,0.0,0.0981370896210586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14197764897324888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10153196798023717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2548797090309001,0.18510272716982848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12619965943348455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14393444851298515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12698807341772195,0.10616372414471033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1392685210031615,0.0,0.13703475483968292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1889824893623237,0.14229211923769738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2791241787719536,0.0,0.0,0.3029860552753269,0.0,0.0,0.1003745970535782,0.10730140001795653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07784431193779541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2573764498164782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09483382456658232,0.0,0.0,0.17193789510532448

I'm a reporter commissioned to do a piece on dating while in recovery. I would like to highlight some of the challenges that may face a newly sober person when they try to put themselves ""out there"" again. Is the ""wait 1-year rule"" really a thing? (i've been told otherwise. Also, I'm curious to talk to a recovering addict who has been in a relationship for a while now, and what works for them. Also, addiction counselors offering insight is great too!

addiction,Stonecoldwatcher,2018/02/22,"My caffeine addiction history I just need to write about my problem somewhere. I've had multiple chronic diseases in my youth and while growing up, constant inflammation, steroids and bad blood levels made me constantly tired. I started going to the gym when I was around 14-15 years old, I was still very very tired. I found out about Pre workouts from a friends. They made my life alot better at that time, gave me energy to focus on school and going to the gym. But that was also a problem since I associated it with going to the gym since I took around 300 mg caffeine 5-6 times a week. I drank PWOs/energy drinks, high dosages of caffeine for years without break because of this. 

Cut to now, sort of. I've experienced alot of anxiety last couple of years and I never really associated it with the caffeine but some things started to clear up recently. I had this allergy in my esopagus and I thought that the energy drinks helped my condition, but in really it most likely made it worse, but they gave me energy when I was having episodes, rougly 2 times a week. 

A year ago I had surgery for some problem in my colon, I still drank like 500s mgs of caffeine daily, I tried to stop but it wasn't until after the surgery I realized that I needed to stop it due to it being bad for my stomach. So I went cold turkey for a couple of months. It was easy because I laid in bed for months on end and nothing that I needed to do. At the summer I thought, ehm, what the heck I will drink one bad boy. Poof I from that day started drinking 1 can a day and slowly increased the dosage as time went on. 

In the autum I moved back to my university city, I then was a year after everyone else and was really lonely because I didn't stay in touch with people. And I still drank my energy drinks. I drank more and more and more. Because they sort of soothed my lonliness by quick rewards. Untill one day, I had the worst panic attack ever, it stayed on for weeks. I first didn't know what the problem was but after a while I realized that it was associated with me drinking theese energy drinks. Ok I stopped  everything, accepted that it was ok to be tired and started drinking tea. That didn't help the problem that much either. Hearth palpations and irregular heart beat, I went and did EKG's and everything. The only thing I could think of that caused the problem was the caffeine. It got better and after a while my body started to get better. 

In December during exam times, I yet again thought, ehm what the heck! One can not hurt, poof poof poof, and I was drinking 2-3 cans a day. They weren't so bad at the start and I didn't get any extreme irregual heart beat. I also started to meet this girl, I got alot of nervousness and anxiety before meeting her. But I actually got worse, bad at conversations, more ""jittery"", I started to shake when it got cold. The energy drinks made me worse. Cut to a couple of weeks in, and she didn't want to see me anymore. I know that it was the energy drinks that had made me into a strange and worse person then I was before, caffeine free. After she didn't want to see me, I got so depressed and had alot of anxiety. I don't think that it was so much because of that I missed her, it was the energy drinks which made me that way and amplified the problem. So I stopped drinking them, poof, I had extreme withdrawl my anxiety got worse I went for candy and I started drinking green tea again (Not realizing at the time that it had lots of caffeine in them, 4-5 cups a day). I still got a lot of anxiety, thinking about everything. 6 weeks later (sort of now) I have gone into an elimination diet to try to fix my allergy which I have had for the last 4 years. I started of drinking green tea, with an extremly restrictive diet. I still had anxiety daily, jumpy mood, almost bipolar. After no real improvment on the allergy so I descided (a week ago) that I would try remove green tea. 3 days in, oh my lord my head, it hurts, and I just want to lay in bed all day. I didn't realize that it was caffeine in that shit. I had so much withrawl and I got an insane crawing for energy drinks, cokes or whatever. Guess what? I caved in. Looking back, my anxiety is strongly related to my caffeine intake and I made my addiciton worse when associating it with well being when I was extremly ill. I'm now sipping on an energy drink and already feeling extremly anxious when I'm about the meet a couple of friends in 3 hours. I bought it togehter when caffeine free tea, so I can drink something similar when I have crawings. I plan on this being the last day that I drink caffeine. Because it's ruining who I am.

addiction,shatteredbrokenlost,2018/02/22,"I found my daughter overdosing One week ago I found my baby girl overdosing in her room. She is 17. Her mother and I are separated and live in states many miles apart. I have full custody. My daughter recently broke away from a VERY abusive relationship of 3 years. He hit her, he emotionally abused her, he convinced her I sexually abused her, he had her thinking he was some super powerful unbeatable bad ass. He is 6 foot 155 fucking pounds of bitch. He constantly cheated on her. He forced her to take drugs. I mean literally forced pills into her mouth. And this is just what I know.  
Her mother/my ex wife was a pill and coke addict. She eventually kicked that. She cheated on me many times and had an affair with my nephew who I was very close to, throughout our entire marriage. I was devastated when I found out and that was the anvil that broke my back. I fell into a deep depression. I was blind to what my daughter was witnessing. My daughter once saw my ex wife's father raping her. Maybe more? I just know of the one time which I found out after the FIRST time my daughter overdosed trying to get her abusive bf's attention. I'm sorry I'm going all over the place with this shit. I Just need to get this out.   So back to a week ago. She has a new bf. He seems like a druggy to me. Nice kid, but definitely off. She finds out that her ex asshole bf was telling things about her that wasn't true. BTW, she has an order of protection against him and is going to court next week to testify that he assaulted her a few months back. I guess the straw for her was that last assault. He wouldn't let her leave the house and attacked her when she did. His mother covered for him..AGAIN. CUNT. So here he is spreading false info about her to her friends and people she knows. Making shit up about her. She got very upset. Her current bf came over and at 11pm he had to go because my GF had work in the morning. I was off. I let her hang outside a little while longer while I played video games in the living room. about midnight she came in stomping up the stairs. I thought she was just trying to piss my GF off. Turns out she was falling up the stairs. About 1 am I hear some weird noises. I don't how I heard anything. I can't hear someone talking right next to me with my Turtle Beach's(headset) on. I took one ear off and listened. The sound stopped. As I was putting the headset back I heard it again. I got up and listened at the steps. I thought it was the cat with a hairball or something. I heard it again. I went up the steps and knocked on her door and called her name. No answer. I opened the door and saw her on her bed, eyes rolled back making a horrible squeaking sound. I thought maybe she was sleeping. She has sinus issues so I thought maybe that? I walked over to her and shook her. Nothing. I called her name and shook her more. Nothing. I started screaming her name and shaking her harder. Nothing. The fear fucking rushed through my chest. Holy fuck. I yelled to my gf to call 911. I ran down the stairs. She comes out and I said go help her she's overdosing. My GF is CPR certified. Turns out she didn't remember shit. I called 911, gave them the info and ran back upstairs. I told my GF to wait by the front door for them. I asked the 911 operator what can I do. He told me to lay her flat on the ground and tilt her head back. I picked her up. She was dead fucking weight. Breath into her mouth for a second, wait 6 seconds and do it again. It was horrible. She was turning purple, breathing slower, looking dead. Eventually after what as the cliche goes ""seemed like forever"", the EMT and police showed up. They gave her Narcan and carried her out. She was still out as they brought her into the ambulance. I called her mother. I was hysterically crying. At this point I didn't know if she would live. One of the EMT's came over to me and told me she was awake. I was so relieved. Turns out she had taken coke and heroin..snorted most. There was a line left on her Nintendo switch.
We were at the hospital for 14 hours. When we got home she saw the line and flushed it. Apparently she didn't mean to OD, she did too much. So she says. I sent her to her mothers to get away from all this shit, but she needs to be back to testify next week.
  She spent 2 months in rehab last year after oding. She then went to an outpatient for dual diagnosis. She may have BPD. Do I send her again to a rehab? Maybe an outpatient again? I believe it's more a psychological thing than a drug thing. But does that really matter? She wants to live. She wants to go to college. She wants her drivers license. She wants a car and to work and to finish school. But she is hurting and broken. She needs help and I don't know what will help. She hates me for sending her to rehab last time. I don't care if she hates me as long as she gets help, but I don't know if it helped. There is so much more I just puked out enough on here I guess. I have cried so many times the last week. I keep seeing my baby girl gasping and dying. That poor girl is so hurt. I don't know what to do.",0.7919064211050291,3.1819533867832845,1.9381834127379167,96.06727369693523,86.56073858114675,4.9012491407712915,19.444570859702765,6.386884672996322,-0.05185609045011708,3941,114,870,40,123,1244,396,1029,0.159,0.792,0.048,-0.999,5,0,5,0,2,0,136.0,3,0,4,6,41,42,19,5,49,0,70,34,16,4,3,129,164,61,4,12,14,16,1,2,10,4,10,14,7,4,34,59,3,5,26,5,2,31,12,32,0,7,70,23,183,10,119,86,14,157,0,5,8,6,180,68,12,12,58,557,217,4,0.0,0.21918782379028398,0.0,0.0504177339124012,0.0,0.0,0.08199307846767623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03805860686165682,0.0,0.043236140752505536,0.05261438962399317,0.08690404936014477,0.2844981731317773,0.03861559815627179,0.028192680033618182,0.0,0.0,0.0521062659129137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058248415703803486,0.0,0.2361246454303073,0.1586880231584369,0.04715346768465545,0.0,0.0,0.03983902111367234,0.0,0.04997824042737116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10160369657601916,0.0,0.0,0.0398337987627455,0.0,0.04799868164764885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04047240803124568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1072672443069378,0.0,0.0,0.05202338134907683,0.0,0.04778710366962259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0520424640913993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04227032666707902,0.03933898353937426,0.0,0.20283654296979367,0.03573150640888919,0.1710241157965833,0.09665181089256793,0.0,0.13142055219787124,0.0,0.11096754426372324,0.0,0.10189595935017258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09132171454520112,0.047464343587579394,0.0,0.104250929102793,0.0,0.1549971036463683,0.0,0.04639105536507807,0.0,0.04554549473127628,0.05336460441185674,0.09902003479735316,0.0,0.0,0.04827145883588234,0.0,0.04110782634240459,0.0,0.0,0.1779189122260855,0.15079492756730184,0.0,0.048970524904757916,0.0502491728070119,0.09458452886422283,0.0,0.04518939997891891,0.04635318587794686,0.1633532285498014,0.04092850154604091,0.03883712466123973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061742517647156436,0.14066627826631034,0.1858514940965876,0.1007564341131144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07383028498340619,0.0,0.06799599499361512,0.10287811668386654,0.0,0.04466712703651831,0.14755753730929946,0.0,0.0,0.13313016113616594,0.0,0.0,0.04925318451081824,0.12535682744800095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032062913620487486,0.0,0.04831987962265645,0.0,0.04371981808391532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046492555499607034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029627998263622057,0.0,0.045664852671874964,0.04965362271719593,0.05239057892937025,0.039495999499896586,0.04399295127714585,0.03677869439230979,0.0,0.04680599043121829,0.03685409766334037,0.08420586563283758,0.0,0.0,0.18989384217546448,0.0,0.0,0.046281939014759486,0.0,0.03918623690498879,0.03560438472368226,0.0,0.051771452844779034,0.032734953854297096,0.0,0.036934142885723685,0.03866584937039008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034773145530885466,0.03717282368267446,0.04042326146194821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09217642258649716,0.029634196275725062,0.0,0.14686469541324648,0.13483947468898494,0.0,0.0,0.13257738249249193,0.05138382839243781,0.06279944412201177,0.20122051876667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1144796643273538,0.1091143459426924,0.0,0.18548894107566616,0.05631826091851101,0.0,0.08574571775927829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06733897423409972,0.0,0.0,0.032853635080039134,0.0,0.0,0.05956508543272336
addiction,Digitalpaver,2018/02/22,"6 ways to overcome phone addiction In this time and age, it is very hard not to become addicted to one thing or the other. The addiction that is gradually sweeping the millennial generation like a widespread virus is that of addiction to the phone. Addiction can be substance or drug-related. In the case of that of a phone, it is behavioral related. The funny thing about this is that a lot of people are not aware of their addiction status when it comes to the use of the phone. People don’t plan to be addicted; they just become addicted to things they find fun.

The High IQ makes it easier to manipulate pretty much any situation. I feel like the smart addicts either live to old age or die young. This is mere conjecture.

addiction,goodfrienddoc,2018/02/23,"Your experiences seeking treatment? Hello,

In 2013 my little brother died of a heroin overdose at the age of twenty. This experience has affected me in a lot of ways, including motivating me to do something. 



I'm hoping to hear about what its like to seek help for an addiction. I work in film and I'm working to produce a documentary short looking at what the experience is like in the most honest way possible. I'm not trying to scare anyone, I just want to share that experience with people who haven't been through it first hand.

My personal motivations for this are rooted in my thriving need to want to help break the stigma of addiction. I have been awarded some time this spring and have thought about doing this for a long time so I'm reaching out wherever I can. The only stakes I have in this are the dissemination of people's experiences to help break the stigmas of addiction.

addiction,asiasilu,2018/02/23,"Smoking Over the last few years I've developed a habit of smoking. At first it was weed and I would be high all the time, whether at work, going to university classes or just in everyday life. Honestly at the time it helped to calm me down and to think about my life and past childhood issues. As time went on I moved to cigarettes and weed. There was nothing like the feeling of smoking weed and then a few moments later to smoke a cigarette. As time went on I realised I spend more money smoking than I do on food and even thinking of buying new sheets or a pair of shoes I'd have to wonder if I really needed those, but I would buy weed without any hesitation.

As it currently stands I don't feel as stressed as I used to feel and I can actually see how I can get my life in order, but its a scary thought because it requires me destroying all that I currently  am to rebuild a new. Smoking no longer gives the great feeling it used to, but its become a crutch that I'm terrified to let go of and embarking on what I think will make my life better seems even more terrifying. I've started to feel guilt each time I smoke and am constantly using excuses that it helps me to deal with people and everyday life and can even see myself experimenting with more addictive drugs. But I did a check of everything I spent money on last year and the amount that was unaccounted for left me feeling even shitter because I know I spent it on weed and cigarettes. 

Honestly I'm trying to figure out the first step and actually get myself to do it on how to stop or even to just do it on rare occasions.

addiction,MotoMola,2018/02/23,"Always an addict. (health/fitness) I just realized that my entire life now revolves around my fitness and health. Meaning I avoid anything which may obstruct me from reaching goals.  
I have no problem spending my time away from work or the gym, around the house where I have convenient access to all my nutritional and supplementary needs. (Kitchen/food, vitamins...etc.). As well as a room where I can stretch and/or rest. (living room).

Is this excessive, or what?  
I avoid ""going out"" and would rather not have friends who aren't as focused, and determined as me.  

I did have a problem with addiction to alcohol/drugs due to being raised by an abusive alcoholic father, and feel straying from health just means closer to being an addict and self-medicating again. 

IDK, I feel like it's difficult to find balance, it's one thing, or another, to the extreme.  

Yes, I am single, and don't have any close friends, but get along with family.",4.363439349112426,7.0049584615384655,4.379079142011836,82.47974297337281,73.85207100591715,7.538609467455621,29.49741124260355,8.472884824447931,2.473180177514793,736,32,128,14,16,227,113,169,0.121,0.818,0.061,-0.7758,0,3,3,0,0,0,41.0,0,0,0,2,10,9,0,2,8,1,15,7,0,0,1,36,22,15,0,5,8,1,2,1,2,2,7,0,2,0,8,14,1,2,6,1,1,1,4,5,1,1,1,2,15,4,21,17,3,17,0,0,0,0,4,12,0,4,5,92,23,2,0.0,0.15129972647299084,0.0,0.4176248051606855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.272937907144378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1062538966748293,0.0,0.0,0.0868381452902349,0.13390114004181927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10508351620154216,0.2273542997313781,0.0,0.0,0.11997526751454556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14808764868872776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1424155926277666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12038109843949395,0.0,0.12913459219452916,0.0912265589035652,0.0,0.0,0.1167124843353004,0.0,0.15441137498184104,0.0,0.1973163309036875,0.0,0.06671626324077302,0.0,0.07257298605963433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4072069108917074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14734486453186246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0901959664353968,0.062386164870460115,0.0,0.11275853909527465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2781983170067657,0.14184226350066495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09468549633315544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08653059908360286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24437702138969564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13321552364489933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08483602348239584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07446098158344695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11481468278630046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09296472957675933,0.0,0.0,0.090712082729729,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,PlNG,2018/02/24,"Strategies for living with a retired work addict? Slowly coming to the realization that my not-so-recently retired mother is a work addict. 2/3 days she's got some major job or work leading question lined up. I'm starting to tell her what she wants to hear just so I don't fucking have to work during my downtime. My vacations have become nonexistent since starting my full time job (Thanksgiving was work filled, spent christmas sick, and I've been working solid the last two weeks with the broken promise that I would have this weekend OFF), I haven't had a two day weekend in 6 months.  It should've been a giant red flag that I was fighting for downtime at our summer house during vacations. Avoiding her is becoming less effective as she will just trap me or seek me out. I feel so burned out on doing any work at all. I've just been asked/ordered to go clean the gutters today, on a saturday in winter.",6.832857142857144,6.867877000000004,6.743571428571428,77.8839285714286,64.71428571428571,9.057142857142855,33.5,8.548686976883017,2.6922,725,28,130,9,10,230,113,175,0.081,0.863,0.056,-0.6361,2,1,0,0,2,0,19.0,1,0,0,9,5,4,2,1,9,0,16,4,0,2,1,20,27,6,0,2,5,1,1,0,0,2,3,1,1,0,6,6,0,1,3,2,1,4,2,3,0,2,8,3,17,1,20,17,5,30,0,0,1,1,11,12,1,4,14,82,23,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28048473249704303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08748321574037983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2841572543950988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1108165353031061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16593115245836768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06504692926560203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11893050730198755,0.0,0.0,0.07311208887705843,0.0,0.1028893987406036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14499260326123442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1484394044690345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25532122079949465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10486308992514587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11359615718728668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10268345147032452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14411217836255175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1064167219149456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1821116115825104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11244166286323064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07501410922968732,0.0,0.12194070272512506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2513355312900731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07587833128939486,0.0,0.1031915002549748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6555871761930618,0.0,0.0,0.09138593042470768,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,CrustyBoxers,2018/02/24,"New to this. I believe I've developed an addiction to cocaine. During the working week I am completely sober, I don't even touch a drop of alcohol. I am very good at my job and many peers look to me for technical advice.  However, on the weekend all I can think about is drinking and doing cocaine. Even now I have been staying up all night with a card and a bill. I wish I could sit here and say that it could be my peers pushing me to use the substance. However, it is in fact the complete opposite. I am the one bringing up the idea of finding it. This might not be an issue if I had brought it up this one time but this is far from the first. 

I hide it from my family members who only see the success I've made in my career. I hide it from the woman I love who is moving across the continent to be with me. I glorify it to so called friends who are amazed that I'm still successful despite the use. 

I want to tell those closest to me that I have an issue and need help, but am afraid of them rejecting me. If somebody could provide some advice, or maybe a personal story of their own to help guide me into stepping into the light I would be very thankful.... I'm not sure what I'm looking for here, maybe some personal experiences or advice.

I need someone to talk to I am so sorry,1.0673809523809543,3.2885662142857166,3.2214285714285715,88.59023809523809,83.28571428571429,6.590476190476192,25.404761904761905,7.793537801064563,1.5828547619047622,212,9,44,4,6,72,42,56,0.085,0.797,0.118,0.4402,0,0,2,0,0,0,5.0,0,1,1,1,8,3,0,0,4,0,6,3,0,2,0,8,10,6,0,3,2,2,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,2,1,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,2,8,10,1,2,0,1,0,0,7,1,0,2,2,35,8,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2413381839425333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4731783507013359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19707620260098885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24333063464351995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10815567140833476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16415135390687974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15347784885610372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5627267143713717,0.0,0.0,0.24781812747344095,0.0,0.0,0.17679531144738966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35587564388275705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14707583161112667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,Bagged_Milk,2018/02/25,"Friend is currently going through withdrawal; how can I best be supportive? Right now I'm sitting with my friend in a hotel room, on the other side of the country from where we live, and the people who trigger her to smoke crack, as she goes through her third day of withdrawal. Before we left she'd decided she wanted to quit, but kept telling me she'd have a ""natural high"" from being where we are; I'm not an idiot and knew full well what was going to happen, and that being in a new city with no contacts to buy from was exactly what it would take to get things started. 

So now I'm watching as she struggles with the discomfort and pain, trying to figure out what I can do to make things less shitty for her. She was a heavy user (multiple times a day, at least for the past month. A user for over a year before that), so I know that the road ahead is no cake walk, but is there anything I can do to make her more comfortable? She's been drinking (another addiction, but we're tackling one at a time) to try and level out, but obviously that's going to have limited success, and I don't want her hurting herself in one way to try and compensate for something else.

addiction,JellyfishJuicer,2018/02/25,"Not sure if I belong here. I've abused a variety of drugs in the past.. prescription drugs, pain killers, weed, alcohol, psychedelics. The reason I've never thought I could have a real problem is because I'm always able to quit. Nicotine/ alcohol/ pain killers/ amphetamine. I've quit it all. It's just I've never gone too long without taking anything. I'll usually move on to another drug after going a bit without what I'm used to taking daily. 

I use daily. I honestly have such a difficult time wanting any daily life besides the one where I can zone out a bit with the help of some drugs. I've tried mediation in the past and it made me truly happy but drugs are so much easier and go so much further. Daily sobriety sucks. I want the abstract thinking. I want the escape. I want to get out of it. 

I want to live a life where I can take some mind altering drug everyday while also staying healthy. I'm here because in the past few days I crossed a line I never thought I would. I put other people's lives in danger and it made me hate myself so damn much. And in part the reason I did what I did was because I felt trapped by using and putting off responsibilities. 

Makes me think what I really need to do is find a more compatible drug. If I can quit highly addictive drugs can I truly be an addict? I just can't see a life where I can't tilt things a bit as one I'd like to live. 

I'd just like to talk to someone about what's up. AA and similar programs seem so extreme with their abstinence only teaching and religious BS. Have you dealt with similar problems and found a way to get a break from things still?

addiction,shagvvrath,2018/02/25,"Alcohol, Cigarettes, and Benzos. So i probably already know the answer to this, but I'm sure there are a few out there with first hand experiences. Background im 29, started binge drinking when i was around 17, and really never stopped for longer than a month, two weeks is rare.

Alochol wise id get drunk probably every four days, fifth deep stay up to see the sun drunk. I'd smoke probably 3/4s of a pack of cigarettes, and then upon waking up drink a bunch of water and take a mg of xanax once or twice a day. That was my typical binge, and the entire next day was dealt with coping with the hangover and trying to remember the conversations i had in a full black out (full functioning).

Last saturday i caught the flu thats been going on around, so ontop of that sucking a bag of dicks, no nicotine, no alcohol, and i knocked the xanax (prescribed) 3/4s.

Its been a week now, and i dont have the flu and i figure id keep sticking to drying out, but i am fucking miserable. My sleep is incredibly disturbed (fall asleep at 5pm, wake up at 9pm, rinse and repeat) and every now and then I'm just sweating bricks.

I honestly have no urge to drink or smoke (only smoke when i drink), i just am over this whole half lucid day time. I honestly couldnt tell you who i texted yesterday, or what time you want to say yesterday was.

So is it stupid to try and cut out three things at once? Or when is the reprieve of this mind splitting headache going to be over.

If theres any younger kids out there, when you start saying things like ""i can't get drunk off beer, i only drink liquor"" or something that affect.. you are not on a good path buddy. You'll soon be having visits from the honest pure horror of staring death in the face that is an alcohol withdraw panic attack.",5.062102272727274,5.435087823863636,5.53409090909091,83.88363636363638,68.48863636363637,8.786363636363637,27.93181818181818,8.710501217029153,1.8638647727272728,1382,42,284,21,22,444,199,352,0.165,0.754,0.081,-0.9871,0,0,15,0,0,0,50.0,0,5,0,1,18,15,5,3,22,0,25,27,8,1,3,47,41,30,1,3,11,0,1,1,0,1,7,2,0,1,14,23,14,2,4,10,0,5,8,8,0,6,8,6,22,7,43,29,5,59,0,1,3,2,12,24,3,6,30,180,36,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3132717779067221,0.0,0.0,0.10782712001241057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06644720148944319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17396798277128742,0.0,0.1111609888984893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2520634530284541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11451720339773692,0.4786005762002404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16465238239343785,0.0,0.0,0.09558064069876344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08311339053345364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09033274914572262,0.10210049906906266,0.0,0.11106344593790736,0.08195580832177281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10554523633124993,0.0,0.0,0.08685051105496895,0.0,0.0,0.05369970993034792,0.07964795082224667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04773692544268609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09866080634299472,0.0,0.07799242325211869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07536116747668596,0.0,0.10391733696141772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2081192136124522,0.0,0.14862806653385516,0.0,0.1146434453047909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31604871670958423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06259651797927658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11068813312047612,0.0,0.0,0.15540828538587131,0.0,0.0,0.07786345086383416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09778211142972444,0.0,0.0,0.07522312134173166,0.0,0.0,0.13832146939249845,0.10414750637661348,0.0,0.08169122712111744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09209197509571246,0.0,0.07346692172898661,0.0,0.08540419742060902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12983041788967814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139527757033613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13267945063634926,0.0,0.09544998173506346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05763280104873809,0.0,0.1567566155727249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1090914508696256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,Insatiababe,2018/02/25,"My boyfriend said he wants to go to rehab, but now he's backpedaling My on/off long distance boyfriend of 3 years has suffered from various addictions for the past 10 or so years (opiates, marijuana, alcohol, stimulants, who knows what else). He's currently on a job contract in an isolated poverty-stricken town, which has contributed to his depression, loneliness, and feelings of isolation. This only fuels the addictions and secretiveness about them. He stays in this miserable, abusive job because it enables him to use and keep loved ones at a literal distance.

He finally came to the conclusion on his own that he needs to go to rehab. He's talked about it in the past, but this time it seemed like he was really ready to go. He told his family, which is HUGE, as he's usually VERY secretive with them about all things, especially this. I've been the only person he's really told about his addictions, and he definitely keeps things from me, too.... so telling his family that he wanted to go to rehab was a huge step forward.

He started seeing an LCSW in order to get a referral for treatment, and did call a few rehabs, though it seems like lots of them don't take his insurance. He seemed to like the counselor and found her helpful. This all seemed like it was going in a good direction.

This was over a month ago. Since then, he's had to miss a few therapy sessions due to scheduling issues, and he's completely lost the momentum to see this through. I think he's had some relapses and is using/drinking again, which resets the shame spiral that zaps his motivation. He's withdrawn from me and his family, ignores our texts and calls for days at a time, and hasn't mentioned rehab in weeks. When I ask about it and/or therapy, he's avoidant.

I'm so disappointed and discouraged. I feel very helpless and I know I can't do anything for him... he has to see this through himself. I've offered to help him in any way I can in terms of finding the right rehab place, etc. He doesn't seem to want myself, and if I bring it up too often, it feels like I'm nagging. He was just SO CLOSE and I wish there was something we could do to get him motivated and back on track to getting help. I'm trying to be supportive, but I just feel so frustrated.

 I want a future for us, and I want nothing more than for him to get help so that we can have a real shot at a life together. I wish he would just quit this job, move back home here and get the help he needs where he has love and support from me and his family... but that would require his full commitment to change his life, and clearly he's ambivalent, so he stays where he can hide and uses his job as an excuse.

I'm not sure there is any advice anyone could offer... I mainly just posted this to vent a bit if what I'm going through. But if anyone has been in a similar situation, feel free to share your story.

addiction,madhammachck,2018/02/26,"I'm embracing the fact that I have been living as a 14 year old meth addicted, violated teenager for too long. I'm sharing my experience to hopefully help others not feel so alone. I’m embarking on a journey of self realizing shit.  

I ordered Mastin Kipp’s, “Claim Your Power: A 40-Day Journey to Dissolve the Hidden Blocks That Keep You Stuck and Finally Thrive in Your Life’s Unique Purpose”.  It’s basically a 40 day self discovery class.  I’m only on day 8 and a big part of what he talks about is how our past traumas are the things that get in our way of truly living our purpose.  “Hell yeah”, I thought to myself.  I definitely have some past shit that has defined who I am today.  As I’m working through the pages of Mastin Kipp’s book, I start to see.  I start to see how much pain I’ve been living in.  I start to see where it all began.  It’s becoming so clear.  It’s wild, why haven’t I sat down and dealt with any of this?  Maybe because I always felt that it was too painful to revisit?  Oh, I almost forgot, I’ve been drunk ever since.

My drinking and drug use where a direct solution to my pain.  My drinking has been my conclusion, my safety net and my comfy blanket since I was 14.  Yes, you guessed it, my running started when I was 14.  There was what Mastin Kipp calls your “original incident”.  The original trauma that sparks your numbing.  I feel I didn’t have the proper tools or the maturity to deal with what happened.  Now I’m forced to back up, take a moment and use my new found maturity and tools to FINALLY face my deepest fears.

Actually a few things happened when I was a new budding, flowering teenager.  It started when I straightened my hair and got contacts.  I wanted so badly to fit in.  I did finally, sort of.  At least I thought so.  I don’t want to go into great detail about a couple things that happened, but I do want to talk about the aftermath or a better description would be afterMETH.  Ha, I can still have a sense of humor about the whole thing.  

So what happened was I had hooked up with a older guy, he was 18 and I was 16.  This part is where my heart starts beating super fast, my palms get sweaty and I have a huge knot in my stomach.  Just write it out Molly, just fucking do it.  He videotaped us having sex and decided to show it to his friends.  Ironically, or maybe it was more of a coincidence, when I first found out about this, this was also the same night I tried meth for the first time.  

I’ll never forget when I walked into this high school party and I walked up to a group of my guy friends and one of them looks at me with wide eyes and says, “I saw your video”.  My  heart stopped in that moment.  No it didn’t stop, it was actually beating quite fast from all the “cocaine” I had done.  I say “cocaine” because the guy that sold it to me and my friends said it was cocaine.  Come to find out later that is actually meth.  Anyway, I look at my friend and say, “What video?”  His face changed.  His smile faded to a look of concern and he explained to me that, let’s call him S, had videotaped us having sex and showed a bunch of his friends.

My world starts spinning.  I remember going back to my group of friends and telling them what I had just heard.  They did what any good high school girlfriends would do.  We went into the nearest bathroom and took shots of SKYY vodka and did lines of “cocaine” off the toilet.

Yup.  This was the night that I became addicted to meth.  I went on to use it morning till night for 6 months.  I hardly slept, I hardly ate.  I withered away to skin and bone.  My days and nights were spent hiding in people's garages snorting lines of meth.  Man those were dark days.  I got other friends and acquaintances addicted to meth.  I couldn’t dig a hole by myself, I needed others to help with the labor.  

One girl I helped get addicted smuggled some on a plane with her to go visit her family.  She stuffed it in her panties and boarded the plane.  She didn’t get caught, but jesus, imagine if she had?  Two other girls I used to use with got in horrible car accidents.  Meth has to be the worst drug on the planet.  Well, at least it was for me.  I remember snorting my first line of it and feeling like I would do this forever.  It was instant addiction.  I never wanted to stop.  I think the powerlessness I felt hearing about being videotaped was battled with the “all powerful” I felt when I was on meth.  It gave me the strength and the tools to deal with being violated.

Let me explain real quickly how I stopped.  I started dating a guy and he wanted to use meth with me.  So I snorted lines of meth with him and I hated him while he was high.  He was so annoying.  Then it clicked, maybe this is how people saw me while I was on meth.  Through the thick cloud of smoke I had been living in, I saw that I was worth more than this.  So the guy I was dating helped me stop using by feeding me vicodin and smoking weed.  I know, fight one addiction with more drugs.  It worked.  I stopped using meth cold turkey.  I did however start smoking weed and drinking alcohol quite a bit.  I may have stopped using meth, but I had not dealt with the very thing that was keeping me scared.  

Which leads me to today.  I may have stopped using meth cold turkey, I may not drink or use other drugs, but I am still scared.  I still feel powerless.  I’m trying to figure out how to claim my power.  I’m working on being honest with myself.  I’m writing out my past traumas and really looking at them.  Reliving them and trying not to blame myself.  I’m trying to see them as shitty things that have happened and they do not define the beautiful person that I am today.  They may have happened, but that’s okay.  

Maybe my purpose is to share these stories and to help others not feel so alone.  Because you aren’t.  None of us are alone in this.  We all experience powerlessness and pain.  We’ve all been violated in one way or another.  What truly matters is facing it.  To stop running from it all.  To turn around a look fear right in it’s fucking eyes and say hello.  Shake it’s hand and give it a hug.  I’m opening a part of myself I’ve never opened and believe me I’ve opened many parts of myself.  Ha, again, I can still find humor in all the shit.  To look at myself and be able to say, “You’re a beautiful human, who has had shitty things happen.  These things do not define you.  It’s how you choose to look at them that defines you.”  

I open my heart to the world and most importantly to myself.  I’ve identified as the meth addicted, violated teenager for too long.  I’m turning around and I’m looking at her.  She looks tired.  I think she’s had enough.  I think she’s ready to move on.  I reach my arms out and give her a hug.  I allow myself to feel these out of body experiences.  I’ve never been religious, but I find myself wanting more.  I find myself talking to an out of body source.  I don’t know what it is, but it feels like a friend.  Like someone guiding me, so I don’t feel so alone.  

I’m only on day 8 of “Claiming My Power” and I feel pretty fucking great.  I like sitting in the silence and feeling all the anxiety.  This is where the work begins.  ",2.012735004753832,4.105780765987351,3.2924888904964646,90.09324203732795,79.00702740688686,6.040529535777769,23.25311582820057,7.108773556668569,0.7950081063205321,5502,182,1147,66,136,1785,488,1423,0.122,0.755,0.123,-0.6806,11,4,34,0,1,0,165.0,8,11,9,20,55,60,15,5,63,6,106,55,21,21,15,215,235,90,0,13,23,0,19,4,10,7,20,8,0,12,90,79,8,13,36,11,3,19,22,30,1,8,77,51,183,30,164,142,31,180,2,0,19,7,113,72,7,17,89,763,273,10,0.031538575844307366,0.0,0.09233130158935084,0.24067192057254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03370514608418128,0.031581327970231936,0.13065781215156125,0.0,0.025221387708118992,0.02624262160509787,0.0,0.0,0.042894626155955184,0.033070946671841926,0.02412692419601692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05615203813561357,0.0,0.0,0.029631530192157706,0.048502436128333735,0.02633339346280356,0.05767686931263664,0.034831879159976965,0.0,0.03553317487429283,0.0,0.02789330737910921,0.034431956402455305,0.07006449580009277,0.0,0.0,0.06440882432242077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033363631377357116,0.027167690473516127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03489683429842632,0.0,0.12203863378978225,0.06502977368252559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03227491304837785,0.0,0.12358318986478707,0.1462989405770212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03258777963991144,0.0,0.0,0.028528447468718982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09255233686188057,0.029731762444643088,0.07097933214172207,0.15946851575055884,0.04506232976975722,0.0908459361590598,0.10364690473209127,0.11530274780888156,0.08048008950503673,0.0,0.06916084108088473,0.1949330036999349,0.08747071548666484,0.06591041668774714,0.060509351552058735,0.05377229837725627,0.026453061080609127,0.07567284061927937,0.06954278241860498,0.03474329698298518,0.15614074286847518,0.19522620922962333,0.0,0.056504738297761925,0.031137814194728868,0.0,0.0,0.035546267130408385,0.11212009268347914,0.10569821291896377,0.09996671090244362,0.0,0.031324922063828184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05606587064089407,0.0,0.0,0.03466555295803489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06450066120938606,0.02227662882533083,0.061632620330114185,0.0,0.11139656113607396,0.05582129432221727,0.23836014464327154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03197516573090933,0.12673895403328028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02517379034336132,0.03352051490967413,0.0231844821206126,0.023385454364710446,0.0972979759306297,0.060920306159474975,0.0,0.11838726779264945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03309442998909907,0.0,0.08548542086744383,0.04797301622450596,0.13423707333309964,0.0,0.0,0.13661281691042046,0.09032141792290042,0.04372975482680946,0.027538267927669325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032086069956344894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06709031514091351,0.0,0.03589780398378471,0.02020441927725267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07145411670734922,0.026933771447187758,0.03000040788913357,0.1254037068856849,0.06315123273838458,0.06383744503728744,0.1005286465389331,0.0,0.06580322582684571,0.0,0.0971216846480052,0.05217807169812225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026722532966334617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20090849679683787,0.0,0.10074698963721243,0.2373089544880569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0237130840107267,0.07604853781090289,0.027566105406925497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16762262711497214,0.060625937787464126,0.0,0.050076212654544684,0.018390397201324092,0.03624895342110097,0.08968464657457266,0.0,0.03504051821772635,0.0856504910071782,0.06860982797713773,0.0308086058655817,0.0,0.11381107049484218,0.2996312367945101,0.0,0.026022628058417187,0.11161361501577714,0.05006770701068339,0.0,0.0,0.02835696731472429,0.05847315155828672,0.02845865918782092,0.035211693622693704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0918418353491247,0.0,0.0,0.06721229818154625,0.0,0.0,0.020309808810907347
addiction,IAM_KRAKEN,2018/02/26,"am I becoming addicted to ritalin? Ok to start off i’m a 15 year old male with several mental heath issues and I was diagnosed with ADHD at a very young age. About a week ago I was prescribed ritalin (methylphenidate) from my psychiatrist, I picked it up and I started taking it at the proper dose at the right time and how i’m supposed to take it. I then heard from my friend who is into drugs that i could achieve a high from it. me being a curious 15 year old that sounded amazing. he told me how to take the pill and how much to get the best high. so i did that once and i started to feel the effects of euphoria and overall happiness. anyways i’ve been doing that consistently for about 4 days now and i sometimes do it twice in a day. the days that i tell myself that i won’t do it at all i eventually cave in.

what do you guys think, am i on the early stages of addiction, how do i stop? i’m also thinking about bringing this up to my counselor who i trust.",2.496175373134328,3.8714911393034823,4.220817786069651,87.17659981343286,75.4179104477612,7.6120646766169155,26.492848258706466,8.278499904357787,1.6156490049751246,753,28,164,13,16,254,116,201,0.011,0.848,0.141,0.9778,0,0,2,0,0,0,16.0,0,1,0,3,11,6,0,0,13,1,15,8,0,6,1,22,31,14,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,8,2,0,2,16,10,0,1,4,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,6,3,23,6,29,22,3,35,0,0,0,0,10,14,0,0,19,116,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3008799846112518,0.16584876663559672,0.0,0.12232836679275814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1103582733957575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15240977569157751,0.0,0.0,0.14482212290513388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1101814945348939,0.0,0.0,0.26699508108909603,0.0,0.0,0.14006674387646534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1600357865767956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06977677145635673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10661819030901584,0.0,0.07209912345656944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13664135367261265,0.0,0.1469031977093944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29160842218302885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1440357852748566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13907119330379464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10144562408760643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2896148455335042,0.14696512762174194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11785095044515588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1559003289093427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13648518638600451,0.0,0.29303059601142634,0.0,0.0,0.11537388990704317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31127569647604225,0.0,0.12061778012216427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17684921212243992,0.0,0.0,0.08046870797465966,0.0,0.0,0.13186458318233849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11386416699119425,0.0,0.0,0.11069499837769646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17773450527848358
addiction,fartless_bastard,2018/02/26,"Addiction and just buying drugs is just so much bullshit. long story short, buddy of mine ripped me off on some 20 dollar ice deal.  I was really surprised. He tried to trick me and then make up something.
He really hooked me up to make up for it but it's bullshit.

But he did rip me off.  You can't trust drug buddies. 

I have gone to AA 20 times in the last 30 days. Booze is my DOC.  Fake it till you make it.


But you see what I mean? I am not going to kill somebody over 20 bucks but it is the principal of the thing. And trying to pull some shuck and jive thing just adds insult to injury.
That guy isn't my friend and even if he is. He isn't the kind of friend I need if I am to get out of this addiction problem.

addiction,loudbounce,2018/02/26,"Understanding the Science of Benzodiazepine Withdrawal **Understanding BZ withdrawal, Four Major Variables : Half-Life, GABAa affinity, Dosage and Length of Treatment**






-



&gt; Half Life~ Half life is important. *The time it takes for a drug or metabolite to lose half of its pharmacologic activity. Total elimination of pharmaceuticals is appx 6X it's half life.*



-


&gt; The quicker a medication is eliminated the greater the system shock, your brain needs time to reestablished homeostasis or equilibrium with other systems; therefore, a longer half-life medication lets make the taper 'less bumpy,' and 'smoother.'*



-




&gt; [Table on Half Lives of Benzos](http://www.vhpharmsci.com/vhformulary/tools/benzodiazepines-comparison.htm)



-



&gt; So even if you take for example Klonopin or Valium once every 5 days it's still 'constant,' in the sense the drug and/or its metabolites have influence within the GABA system.





-





&gt; GABAa System Deconstructed*~ GABA system is complex and delicate. There are multiple receptors performing different functions and each receptor class responds differently to various benzodiazepines.


-


&gt; Withdrawal symptoms of a particular benzo manifest as the opposite of the effects that benzo has. If a particular benzo causes muscle relaxation, then muscle cramping etc. may occur w/o a good managed taper.



-




* α1 subtype: Sedation, respiratory depression, sleep, ataxia, motor-impairment, amnesia, anti-convulsive, and reinforcing behavior.



-




* α2 subtype: Anxiolysis, disinhibition





-





* α3 subtype: Anxiolysis, anti-convulsive, muscle relaxation



-





* α5 subtype: Learning and memory, amnesia, minor sedation





-





* α3 &amp; α5 subtype: Sensorimotor information processing 








-




* γ2 subtype: Physical dependence, respiratory depression 




-








* β3 subtype: Anti-convulsive, minor sedation, muscle relaxation, various other reactions related to respiration. This receptor subtype is a barbiturate receptor.




-






&gt; **Benzos affinity to the GABA(A) receptors**



-



&gt; High α1 affinity: midazolam, triazolam, flunitrazepam, temazepam, lormetazepam, nitrazepam, brotizolam, nimetazepam, loprazolam, and flutoprazepam.



-




&gt; Low to Moderate α1 affinity: wide range of 1,4 benzodiazepines including diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam, bromazepam, camazepam, quazepam (highly selective affinity), clonazepam, medazepam, nordazepam, chlordiazepoxide (very weak affinity), clorazepate, and most other benzo as all benzos are α1 agonists with varying degrees of affinity levels.



-


&gt; *Also included here are the non-benzodiazepine ""z-drugs"" such as zolpidem, zaleplon, zopiclone, and eszopiclone which act upon the α1 subtype receptor but with only weak to moderate affinity. *I don't like the term non-benzodiazepine, evidence suggests they are not as 'selective,' as previously thought.*



-





&gt; High α2 affinity: diazepam, clonazepam, bromazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam, camazepam, nitrazepam, loprazolam, lormetazepam, and flutoprazepam.




-


 

&gt; Moderate α2 affinity:  oxazepam, prazepam, phenazepam, temazepam, flunitrazepam, halazepam, midazolam, and other less commonly known benzos




-




&gt; Weak α2 affinity: triazolam, chlordiazepoxide (stronger affinity for α3), brotizolam, quazepam, tetrazepam (stronger affinity for α3), and a few others.





-




&gt; High α3 affinity:  diazepam, clonazepam, temazepam, lorazepam, tetrazepam, flunitrazepam, nimetazepam, phenazepam, and bromazepam.





-





&gt; Moderate α3 affinity: alprazolam, adinazolam, estazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clorazepate, and flurazepam. 





-






&gt; High γ2 affinity: **(These benzos are the most physically addictive)**: temazepam, brotizolam, triazolam, alprazolam, lorazepam, loprazolam, midazolam, flunitrazepam, clonazepam, lormetazepam, flutoprazepam, nitrazepam, nimetazepam, and estazolam**




-





&gt; Low to moderate γ2 affinity: diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, oxazepam, and most other benzos.




-





&gt; High β3 affinity: mostly the hypnotics (nitrazepam, temazepam, triazolam, etc)






-




&gt; Low to moderate β3 affinity: diazepam, alprazolam, most other benzos. 




-






&gt; *Dosage and Length of Treatment are self explanatory. Higher the Dose - Longer the Treatment -  More difficult and Protracted the Withdrawal*




-







&gt; *So, the BZs causing the most problems year after year are the short half-life, high γ2 affinity BZs. High dosage and long term use are force multipliers; furthermore, high dose or long term use of BZs with even a low γ2 affinity and lengthy half-life can still create dependency*






-




-





&gt; **Let's Talk Taper**






-





&gt; Before a BZ taper see a Dr. and don't proceed w/o them, but be educated and push back if your facts don't match up with his. Aston Manual.  https://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/ is the bible on this topic download it and bring it to your appointment!*





-



&gt; *Here is a good example of a taper. Everyone is different, but this is as close as it gets online to being the 'right way.'*

-




&gt; Never confuse withdrawal with an underlying previous anxiety disorder! So many think this when there tolerance builds up to benzos and there anxiety builds because the drug has less effect. Law of diminishing returns. So the Dr. ups the dose thinking your anxiety disorder is a chemical imbalance or cause/effect with your life (job, spouse, kids, IRS lol)

addiction,SkyR923,2018/02/26,"Recovering benzo addict: My story. (Warning: wall of text)
I’ve had a lifelong struggle with anxiety. I was always very introverted, and I have had social anxiety and depression since I was a child. I was always searching for ways to alleviate these feelings. So I turned to drugs. Started out smoking weed, then as time went on I escalated pretty quickly to things like LSD, alcohol, adderall, cocaine, ecstasy, etc. Oddly enough, I never had a problem with dependency with those substances. Even the notoriously addictive drugs I’ve tried like blow, alcohol, and opiates never caused an issue with me. I could control myself.

Then I met my match. Benzodiazepines. Namely  Etizolam and Clonazolam (CLam). It started out with the Etiz. Shortly after I turned 18, I bought 25 pills of it as a birthday gift to myself. Then I took my first pill. Little did I know, the moment I put that fucker on my tongue, a world of pain would soon be unleashed.

The first time I took it, it was amazing. I’ve never felt so much relief in my life. It was like this huge weight being lifted off my shoulders, and I finally felt comfortable in my own skin. It made me completely carefree. I had never experienced such a concentrated feeling of relaxation in my life. I was free. Free from the shackles of my anxiety and depression. It was a godsend. I wanted to feel that way all the time.

And I did.

From the moment I took my first pill, I did not want to give up that feeling. So I took another the next day. And the next day. Then I upped the dose. I began taking 4-5mg a day within 2 weeks of my first experience. My addiction escalated VERY fast. 

See, the thing about benzos is that they make you not give a fuck about anything. And I mean *anything*. This is simultaneously the best and worst part about benzodiazepines. Being high on benzos affects your judgement a lot. More so than alcohol I would say. This was a huge problem for me. When your judgment is impaired, you make choices that the normal you would never make. This is how my addiction blossomed. Since I was constantly on benzos, it was incredibly easy to rationalize taking more and more. This is because we all have a little voice inside our head that helps us make decisions. But when you take benzos, that voice gets shut down. So normally, when I’m on a drug binge that little voice says “Okay, that’s  enough drugs. No more.” While you’re on benzos, that voice is gone. You become uninhibited. Therefore it becomes EXTREMELY easy to rationalize taking more. And that’s what I did. I took more and more. I was constantly upping the dose to chase that feeling that I had the very first time. This was my downfall. Because I was always fucked up, the normal me was never there to tell me to stop. Eventually I was taking 15 pills of Etizolam in one sitting without blacking out. So I turned to something more potent. Clonazolam. This drug is an extremely potent benzodiazepine. And eventually, the same thing happened with the CLam. Started out with one pill, then it eventually escalated to 12 in one day. At this point, I am in deep. I was so hooked on these pills that if I didn’t take them every day, I would get horrid withdrawals. I’m talking withdrawals so bad that you hallucinate. It was the worst experience of my life. I couldn’t sleep. And when I did sleep, I had horrible recurring nightmares about centipedes crawling around my room. I had the shakes, nausea, back pain, headaches, time distortion, derealization, strong anxiety, primal fear, delusions, visual/auditory hallucinations. The list goes on. 

And that was just the withdrawal. Being intoxicated all the time had so many consequences. I started failing school, I was constantly lying, I tried to start fights, I was rude as fuck, I cut off my friends and family, and my job docked my pay because they knew I was coming into work plastered. Not to mention all the amazingly stupid shit I did while high. I was constantly falling over, I broke my phone, my 130$ Bluetooth speaker, lost my nametag for work, dislocated my knee, went on a crazy 90mg adderall binge. Not to mention, I literally spent every last dollar I had on pills. My whole bank account: gone. 1,300$ down the fucking drain. That was all I had. And it’s gone now. 

Im not the only one who was affected by my addiction. My family and friends were greatly affected. I lost the girl of my dreams and I cut people off for months just to get high. My mother had to take me to the ER after the school caught me fucked up. She was furious, and for good reason. My dad saw me as a disappointment. 

Then I finally got clean. Coming off 2 months of daily CLam and Etiz abuse is horrifying. Even with a taper plan. Without the pills, I became deeply depressed. Especially because I had finally realized the trail of destruction I had left behind. I was so oblivious to it all before. I started cutting myself, and cried for hours wishing for death. So I decided to get some professional help, and here I am 2 months clean from benzos and alcohol. 

Benzos robbed me of my identity. It turned me into a lying, manipulative, belligerent fiend. I was an instinct driven animal. The pills compromised my survival system. I needed benzos more than food, water, sleep, or sex. No matter what, the drugs came first. I didn’t let anyone stand in my way. I didn’t care if I had to go around you, above you, or through you. The drugs were number one priority. Always. And that’s not an easy spot to recover from.

My benzo addiction was very much a cross addiction with alcohol and other drugs. Because when I was poppin pills, I wasn’t just popping pills. Whenever I took pills I would drink. And whenever I would drink I would smoke cigs. And whenever I would smoke cigs I would smoke weed. My addiction had multiple layers to it, which is why it was so excruciatingly difficult to get clean. 

Eventually, after my third week of tapering I started to feel like myself. And this is where I really learned a lot about my addiction. I realized what caused it, and why I couldn’t stop. Understanding the factors that influence you to take drugs is a huge step in the recovery process. This is how I got clean, and stayed clean. Instead of running from my problems, I faced them head on. And ultimately, through this process I learned who I really was without drugs. 
And I like it. I love having a clear head. I love being able to show up to work, and get praised when the managers notice how much better I am doing now than I was before. I love being able to hold an actual conversation with somebody without nodding off or telling them I don’t give a fuck. I have my life back.

I thought I was never going to get off benzos. I thought I was gonna be hooked for life until it eventually killed me. And believe me, I came very close to death. Taking 12 pills of an extremely potent benzo and washing em all down with vodka is VERY dangerous. And when I was in withdrawals, I could physically feel my body shutting down. I could literally feel myself dying. Looking back, that was the scariest part of my experience with benzos. The withdrawals can easily be fatal. I’m lucky to be alive today.


My purpose in writing this is to give you guys hope. You can recover, even from the most traumatizing addiction. I thought there was no hope for me. I was sure that one day my parents would find me dead in my room from too much sedation. And if I didn’t get clean, I would almost certainly be dead right now. 

I’m doing *much* better now. I finally feel normal (mostly). But recovery is a journey all on its own. I still think about benzos every day, and how bad I wish I could just take some again. But I don’t. Because I’m not gonna risk all the progress I made for a few hours of relief. 

If any of you are struggling with dependency on drugs, don’t hesitate to message me. Trust me, I’ve been in your shoes. I wouldn’t wish this shit upon ANYBODY. My heart goes out to all of you, and I wish you all the best.

addiction,lando421,2018/02/27,"Going Back to Rehab Clean... I am faced with a living situation that has been increasingly deteriorating. I am 31 years old, sober for 2 years with a few relapses here and there - nothing daily or habitual for 2+ years. Currently on the methadone program, and it sucks for reasons I won't outline here.

I have to go back to rehab because I have no options to live, the girl I'm living with wants a relationship and I don't, and I don't want to continue to lie to people to protect myself. So I am being forced out when I tried to make amends and offer my help around the house and a roomate situation because she needs financial help.
I started a youtube channel about a month or two ago, and haven't really uploaded. Decided to make a video today while I am still in this beautiful apartment, as when she comes home she wants to drive me to the city (1hr away) to a homeless shelter so that I have somewhere to live. I didn't even do anything to her, just said to her that I can't see us being together, not right now, while I'm trying to re-learn how to live without drugs.

I am sober, and facing all the problems in my life that caused me to use in the first place - and its tough. I feel the rehab center would be a good place for me to gain some mental stability, as its 4 months of residential living - even though I am abstaining from it, I need mental health.

The unfortunate thing is I have to do a week at the shelter as an ""intake"" before I can move into the residential treatment center, which is beside the shelter and really not a good place to recover.
I dont know what to do. I started the youtube channel to share my experiences with you. Not sure if any of you are interested, but I'll keep uploading all year (as best I can) regardless of how much i grow or views. Thanks. I'm sad, and feeling hopeless.

addiction,Deloit,2018/02/27,"My Girlfriend's Parents Are Angry At Me For Giving Them ""Parenting Advice"" Long story short, my girlfriend of 10 years has a brother who has been up and down with his addiction to heroin and crack for about 5 years. I have largely been quietly supporting my girlfriend on the sidelines, never saying anything directly to the parents. However, there is clearly a pattern of displacement, denial, and enablement on the part of the parents.

Recently, we were at dinner, and the parents were discussing their 30 year old son's recent relapse in which he showed up at his ex girlfriend's job threatening her, and at his apartment building's office doing the same. However, they were excluding and reframing certain information from the past. In particular, they mentioned they never buy him anything and he has been supporting himself. I pointed out they actually bought him a car and $2,000 worth of furniture, and mentioned it's important to set boundaries with someone struggling with addiction.

They promptly lost their shit and became extremely agitated and it became quite ugly. The next day, they told my girlfriend they were primarily angry at me for giving them ""parenting advice"".

Please feel free to share your thoughts. I am looking for honest input to help understand whether or not I was wrong for speaking out, and whether or not it really constitutes parenting advice, given the circumstances. Is it really parenting advice when the person is a grown man?

addiction,zenyogi86,2018/02/27,"How Vietnam War Veterans Broke Their Heroin Addictions It was 1971 and the Vietnam War was heading into its 16th year when two congressmen, Robert Steele from Connecticut and Morgan Murphy from Illinois, made a discovery that stunned the American public.

While visiting the troops in Vietnam, the two congressmen discovered that over 15 percent of US soldiers had developed an addiction to heroin. (Later research, which tested every American soldier in Vietnam for heroin addiction, would reveal that 40 percent of servicemen had tried heroin and nearly 20 percent were addicted.) The discovery shocked the American public and led to a flurry of activity in Washington, which included President Richard Nixon announcing the creation of a new office called The Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention.

The office was created to promote prevention and rehabilitation of drug addictions and also to track and research the paths of addicted servicemen and women when they returned home. It was this last part, the tracking of returning soldiers, that led to some surprising insights.

Lee Robins, one of the researchers in charge of tracking the veterans, found that when the soldiers returned to the United States only 5 percent of them became re-addicted to heroin. In other words, 95 percent eliminated their addiction nearly overnight. 

This finding completely contradicted the patterns of normal addiction. The typical heroin cycle went something like this: an addicted user would enter a clinic and get clean, but once they returned home, the re-addiction rate was 90 percent or higher. Nearly every heroin addict relapsed. The Vietnam soldiers were displaying a pattern that was exactly the opposite.

What was going on here? And, perhaps more important, what can it teach us about changing our own behaviors, building better habits, and breaking bad ones?

Before we talk about how to get started, though, I wanted to let you know I researched and compiled science-backed ways to stick to good habits and stop procrastinating. Want to check out my insights? Download my free PDF guide “Transform Your Habits” here.

How Addictions Get Shaped

Here is what happened in Vietnam: soldiers spent all day surrounded by a certain environment. They were inundated with the stress of war. They built friendships with fellow soldiers who were heroin users. The end result was that soldiers were surrounded by an environment that had multiple stimuli driving them toward heroin use. It's not hard to imagine how living in a war zone with other heroin users could drive you to try it yourself.

Once each soldier returned to the United States, however, they found themselves in a completely different environment. Not only that, they found themselves in an environment devoid of the stimuli that triggered their heroin use in the first place. Without the stress, the fellow heroin users, and the environmental factors to trigger their addiction, many soldiers found it easier to quit.

Compare this situation to that of a typical drug user. The individual picks up a bad habit at home, goes to a clinic to get clean (i.e. somewhere devoid of all the external stimuli that drive their habit), then return to their old environment with all of their old triggers surrounding them, and somehow hope to quit their bad habit. It's no wonder 90 percent of typical heroin users became re-addicted once they return home—they are surrounded by all of the things that caused them to get addicted in the first place.

Similar situations drive bad habits for all of us, from nail biting to smoking to drug use. Of course, none of this is to say that the change in drug use was purely due to environment changes. (It is likely there were a variety of factors at play. ) But the central idea is a solid one: the stimuli that surround you shape your behaviors day after day, often without you realizing it. Environment drives behavior.

To Change Your Behavior, Change Your Environment

The impact that external stimuli can have on behavior is well-known. I have written previously about choice and how it can be used to drive better health habits.

These effects go beyond the physical environment. Your friendships matter too. One popular study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, tracked 12,067 people for 32 years and found that “a person’s chances of becoming obese increased by 57 percent if he or she had a friend who became obese.” 

The people we connect with and the places we live in often determine our behavior and habits as much as we do ourselves.

The good news is that, at least to a certain degree, your environment is within your control. If you want to change your behavior, then change your environment. Even small adjustments can make a difference. One of the simplest ways to do this is to “design for laziness” and make default options healthier or more productive, which is a strategy I covered in detail here.

Here are some other examples to get your creative juices flowing:

Trying to build an exercise habit? Rather than going home after work, stop by a new place like a park or a hiking trail (or a gym, if that's your thing), and let the new environment be a blank slate for your new behavior rather than trying to force yourself to overcome all of the old triggers at your home.

Want to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room or surround yourself with expansive architecture away from the normal space that drives most of your thought patterns. (More on the link between architecture and behavior here.)

Hoping to buy healthier food? It is likely that you have some autopilot shopping habits right now. Try going to a new grocery store and developing a different routine of selecting food. You may find it much easier to avoid unhealthy food when your brain doesn't automatically know where it is located. 

By simply removing yourself from an environment that triggers all of your old habits, you can make it easier to break bad habits and build new ones.

addiction,AMYEMZ,2018/02/28,"Sadness As I struggle with my own addictions, I found out last night that a High School friend has passed.  I knew him, 20+ years ago, and through social media been re-acquainted with this group of friends (we were never close - - although we made out at a party once). Over the years I have known about his serious addiction(s) to hard drugs.  Well, yesterday ... he died from these.  It really breaks my heart as there are young children, and a whole group of people affected by this (just reading the condolences on social media reads like a high school reunion). My thought is no matter what our additions are, we need to help each-other, keep posting, keep reading, keep trying.   Take Care of yourself today.

addiction,iamaverybadpersoon,2018/02/28,"I’ve finally admitted to myself my drug use has gotten out of control. I am a drug addict, how do I tell the people I love? I posted this in /r/relationships but I was hoping some of you here might be able to give some advice. I suppose in this sub my post might not need a trigger warning(?), but just in case: mentions of specific drug use, abuse, depression, suicide 


—————

I’ve spent six hours trying to write this post but there’s just too much to say. I know don’t deserve any sympathy no matter how emphatically I tell my sob story. I have become a very bad person and the only thing I deserve is to be promptly dropped by everybody, then quickly forgotten about. I need help so badly. I’m afraid of what I am.


I am completely and utterly enslaved by my addiction to amphetamines. I used to be such a good person - so caring of others, so sweet and kind hearted. These days I’m the most selfish person I know. I lie, I cheat, I steal and there and I emotionally manipulate people for pity points just to make space for my addiction in my relationships. Needless to say there are very few left and they’re all falling apart.


I am so toxic and I don’t know how to stop. All I know is that I am a cancer to everyone around me. I fucking hate myself so much. I spend $500+ each week on drugs, my pay check is gone within the hour every week without fail. I’ve stolen small amounts of money from my workplace and worst of all, from my parents and my brother. It haunts me every day that I’ve done that.


I used to be so depressed I could barely function and the amphetamines helped with that, but these days I can barely function at all. They’ve robbed me of every redeeming quality I ever had. Not only that but my life is a fucking train wreck if I ever saw one and my brain is jelly. I’m always fucking broke, always manic and wired, entirely unfocused, chronically underslept and nothing short of a slave to any sudden physiological impulse that strikes me. I have no interests, no hobbies, no goals, no plans. I’m honestly just waiting to be saved (like a true victim) or to die.


I can’t live like this anymore. I want to come clean to my family, my friends and my boyfriend and get help, but it seems inconceivable to tell the same people I’ve manipulated and stolen from that I’ve done these things. Like it doesn’t make sense in my head how that conversation could even happen. How do I tell them?


My family is already broken. My mum was physically and mentally abusive to my brothers, my dad and myself for almost a decade. Now she has a severe neurological disorder and isn’t receiving any help for it and my dad is crippled by his trauma and his depression. It broke his heart when I dropped out of uni. This will break my parents. Absolutely shatter them.


My boyfriend has no idea at all and he’s the greatest thing that’s ever happened to me. I’ve never stolen from him but I’m sure the lies and deception alone will drive him to leave me. I think he deserves much, much better than me. I feel awful that I’ve wasted six months of his life convincing him I’m something different from what I really am.


The guilt from everything I’ve ever done is eating me alive each waking moment. I am not equipped to handle it. Its tremendous weight pushes down on me more and more each day, I think I might just crush under its weight sooner rather than later. I am guilty. I am so fucking guilty.


**TL;DR** - I’m addicted to amphetamines. My life has fallen apart, I can’t live like this anymore and I feel like I have to confess to everyone soon but I’ve been lying, stealing from and manipulating those closest to me for a long time. I am terrified and wrapped up in shame.

addiction,doitlive69,2018/03/01,"Oops now I have to have an intervention... Here it goes. 

I have been depressed since I stopped taking my antidepressant - Ultimately I made a decision to go the hospital. Prior to this decision I had to take old meds (seroquel) to sleep which knocked me out for a couple of days after being awake for over 3 days. 

I also had taken a xanax - which without a doubt showed up on the drug test because the Doctors decided to taper me off valium (yeah I take 10mg of that too..)

The resident is this young guy who is obviously the worst poker player ever and probably isn't the best fit for psychiatric work made it obvious that they are essentially detoxing me and wants to have a family meeting next week to go over 'everything.' Namely the non-prescribed alprazolam in my urine...

I'm in the acute withdrawal stage already its been 3 days of which I have been on .75mg of klonopin (tapering from the Rx of 1mg)

Given that I'm already in a psych unit for this major depressive episode I would be damned if this upcoming meeting is not an intervention. 

I acknowledge the facts at hand (i.e I have been using xanax either additionally or in conjunction with my klonopin - marijuana and alcohol.) And with regards to the latter two I have no issue stopping and don't feel any dependcy on whatsoever. The xanax addiction got caught in the cross fires of my admission to the psych unit and is now out of my control - in the past I have been able to seamlessly use my Rx to ward off any WDs. Now I'm feeling them much more and understand why people hate WD so much.

I guess the take away is that at my lowest point in life (contemplating suicide) I managed to get help for my addiction as well - I guess that means I should be happy im getting a 2-1 special.

I can't even imagine how long I am going to be here for (I'm currently forecasting 2 weeks with an inpatient/outpatient rehab for the addiction to follow l.) Send your prayers I will need them.",5.942973128820206,6.334643864721485,6.85937262138162,75.07899319570986,66.58620689655173,10.80055356936916,33.367431668780995,10.662846686107436,3.5790743628185915,1535,64,293,40,23,513,210,377,0.08199999999999999,0.8540000000000001,0.064,-0.7604,3,0,2,0,0,1,42.0,0,1,3,3,12,10,2,1,27,1,32,17,3,6,4,47,63,13,1,5,5,0,4,0,0,3,14,0,0,1,16,13,1,3,9,2,0,7,6,6,1,1,13,4,35,4,56,43,7,49,0,2,0,0,11,22,1,5,19,196,51,6,0.1024213682742042,0.0,0.0,0.3349632281419407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10945729435804193,0.0,0.0,0.22604905351849286,0.08190633120505993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13930008520966178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0962282469988884,0.0,0.0,0.062435115459184176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1074849071075064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11487427358523518,0.0,0.1133272959098479,0.0,0.19815992828541326,0.0,0.17643074883014193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1048326103936234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11877627056573008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06764834778618206,0.09264599133801264,0.0,0.0,0.09204972163690417,0.0,0.09655375074057404,0.0,0.10357464243444447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10702187527437887,0.0,0.17462527167476505,0.0,0.08191572457893465,0.0,0.2256573684823923,0.10141325725604353,0.0,0.10902945104549464,0.0,0.10111989680940862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06865088420441441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.110632653331178,0.10690129857139308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07234324137178139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09063968791017103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19382715021226815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1115668959035932,0.1137670509079598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15058298087042962,0.0759441467988773,0.0,0.0,0.10892628710470563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1074739968751694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09777278523711404,0.07100608070839275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09682129853099547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11042755797383963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08472401422963767,0.0,0.1024953357614715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17125770000503976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11203235323123244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3080324897825925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10005079439701786,0.10662425645700076,0.0,0.1769183549100036,0.0,0.0,0.06041077665427483,0.0,0.16431248733573833,0.0,0.09208911039035317,0.0,0.09241935424271797,0.0,0.0,0.09873054410128272,0.0,0.07456397593622943,0.0,0.0,0.07275720140937937,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,heyitsmely,2018/03/01,"Addicted to olanzapine??? (Zyprexa) Hello! I won’t enter into many details but I have been having zyprexa for about 3 years. My doctor prescribed that medicament to me plus other ones.
Right now I’m sick and tired of it and I want to stop having that kind of medicine.
My parents are thinking of taking me to another doctor that would help me to stop it.
But unfortunately unconsciously I think that I’m addicted to zyprexa. 
I know that because in the night my body asks me for the medication, and I start feeling bad and anxious until I have it. 
Also if one night I don’t have more medicine I have to take 10 or 20mg of melatonin so I won’t feel bad.
What can I do? :( 
What will the new doctor do with me??

Thank you very much for your replies!",1.3498026056060013,3.790400845637585,2.796020529016978,90.62741413343859,84.16778523489933,5.3850769838136605,23.52980655349388,6.794906146795322,0.7590494275562572,582,22,121,7,17,189,88,149,0.21,0.728,0.061,-0.9806,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,2,0,0,4,4,0,0,3,0,16,9,1,0,0,20,29,12,0,3,4,1,2,0,0,4,8,0,0,0,11,7,0,2,5,0,0,1,3,2,0,2,1,2,21,2,20,24,2,13,0,0,0,0,6,3,0,2,9,86,32,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3164215013082439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11605866902309515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15217917818345064,0.0,0.1639531329798482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13567492532937192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2423513433537704,0.08846857494269678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16120429657634133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4456334346867558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1467619775984059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09727612176982424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15112829661064978,0.07975845706467673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14713683558845644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14620101521882786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10668564981624164,0.0,0.0,0.1401653574968067,0.0,0.2723852646076379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19668473998282204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16114727466996615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12393836937555185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1027222213301917,0.0,0.0,0.2426667197775006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21823612566979025,0.0,0.0,0.13361420249594294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18598410019617467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16680308539005873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11974565443798857,0.08560015117260525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10309464278502783,0.0,0.0,0.09345756093938702

addiction,turtlemachines,2018/03/02,"Seeking Advice *Not a user myself, certainly affected by one* About eight years ago, one of my parents started drinking heavily. As time went on and problems between marriage and finances got worse, the drinking amplified and was eventually mixed with prescription pills. Now, after eight long years of terrible experiences and being the target of physical and verbal drunken tantrums, I'm seeking help. 

Of course, I've spoke with my immediate family about everything. Two of my older siblings have walked out, moved out and have learned to keep their distance. Unfortunately, I feel this is not the correct response to the issue. 

In the past year, my parent has lost their spouse (who himself was abusing substances). To make a long story short, I see that this person is suffering and have a very difficult time simply walking away from someone needs support. 

This parent has pushed everybody away and only sees fault after the following day of absolute tragedy (police, kids leaving house to find anywhere else to sleep etc). A few days pass and everybody else is once again at fault. 

I don't know what to do; I would love to turn away like my siblings did but I can not simply leave a human being who has done a lot for me and who has been through hell to suffer alone, even if I'm getting hurt. I have done a pretty good job at keeping a private life from her, and we hardly close to eachother. We have our moments together, but those good moments are often followed by ridiculous outbursts of pain and suffering due to alcoholism. 

I'm overwhelmed. This person is very stubborn and has an argument for everything and a scapegoat for everything. When this person is sober they can be very charming and sweet. 

Awful circumstance that only seems to be getting worse; please help.",6.97746140651801,8.593116660377362,6.4114236706689525,74.84099485420242,64.78616352201257,9.05225843339051,35.52372784448256,9.339509955726095,3.532586163522013,1430,67,226,26,22,441,193,318,0.197,0.693,0.109,-0.9848,5,1,3,0,0,0,39.0,3,0,3,1,8,24,4,1,16,1,31,8,1,2,2,45,55,20,0,4,6,4,2,1,0,1,4,1,0,5,12,22,3,3,5,2,1,8,4,16,0,5,10,6,21,8,43,40,3,40,1,6,2,1,25,11,1,4,22,157,33,3,0.0,0.10805490812735716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08911778758650686,0.08084166727601473,0.09746309913595153,0.0,0.09445379102355156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25705102337683794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11763053861036295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18665476436042416,0.0,0.17867895684602605,0.0,0.0,0.15236872269433846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10171005682580364,0.060235525328272276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24588908024680745,0.08920930115838678,0.08597350990235883,0.0,0.04611253047484691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08335346709577697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09529455026964928,0.0,0.0,0.15298538140790344,0.07293950058106323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08169563924469099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12225641008627733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1052304334659222,0.0976295177147517,0.0,0.0,0.09518718621295932,0.09050010283281623,0.16212223186243535,0.0,0.0,0.05012012432928164,0.0,0.0,0.1931313693627403,0.0,0.0,0.06441595826926239,0.044554814940125566,0.0,0.0,0.16141500555539107,0.0,0.0,0.09955356599549166,0.07753341533138904,0.0823099010504993,0.0,0.060875480731981714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0969292125175807,0.0,0.06762228092394301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971230652372059,0.12359646844243308,0.1387206222000034,0.09704127341050273,0.0,0.3037942961421931,0.0,0.0870589641033167,0.0,0.23889214991355445,0.0,0.1001081946473011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09278131621883104,0.0,0.08726432363846551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14534625393932726,0.08302338074624539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0912640233698504,0.0,0.07727190599194424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06455052785530037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10349059252426544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10635676232380366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09919741111839753,0.0890873518310278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.225744101974906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08454160905998115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18587743497449366,0.06478455707685543,0.0,0.0,0.17618587719149773
addiction,Kylo-raven,2018/03/02,"Share your story, help spread hope. Hi everyone, I am currently working on a youtube channel. I plan on posting videos of people sharing their stories. Mainly about the struggles they have gone through in life. How the found hope, or how they're still hanging on. Each journey is different and there is no level to what you have gone through. No one's story is less than another. I am looking to reach out to those who have no hope to show them that even though so many people have gone through awful things they are still here! If you're not comfortable appearing in a video audio can be submitted. Or the story can be typed out to share on the additional blog I will create. I don't want anyone to feel pressured it's only if you're comfortable. I'm reaching out to people who have gone through so many different things. Depression, anxiety, trauma, homelessness, addiction, and so much more. I'd love to hear from you. So, the stories will be posted on youtube. People will be speaking on the stuggles they went through. It can be as personal as they choose. The length of the vido is up to the person telling their story, it can be a few sentences, or and hour long etc. Whatever they are comfortable with. They will send it to a email account i created just for this. No personal information will be shared I won't use names or locations. No identifying factors. They don't have to show their face in the video it can just be audio of them speaking. The goal is to show others that people have gone through awful things but they are still here. It can be a inspirational video speaking about what helped them through, it can be just sharing their story no matter how dark it is. Anyone is welcome to submit a video. The email is. shareyourstoryspreadhope@gmail.com",3.9724559009843112,6.475281287009068,4.04609687164994,85.07173959653058,74.49848942598187,7.171269856739111,27.293733554234482,8.155646560271837,1.9097207094825064,1410,55,259,24,31,434,152,331,0.08900000000000001,0.8009999999999999,0.11,0.8469,3,0,0,0,0,0,41.0,0,3,15,3,20,18,0,2,18,2,45,4,1,4,0,36,63,20,0,6,11,0,1,0,0,6,2,6,0,3,20,9,0,0,5,10,1,10,10,4,0,1,7,8,25,14,44,40,7,32,0,1,1,1,43,14,0,10,6,195,45,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1276280775720442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12276242845537215,0.08956138555246107,0.0,0.0,0.16372190130063385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10083577273254632,0.0,0.0,0.2446350863554124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13056859706672652,0.0773263557325482,0.0,0.0,0.11186934400535332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05919619553068579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12836573578243735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13195104811341232,0.0,0.1569446369961115,0.0,0.0,0.3488430683786623,0.11529443081912633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08269291712550311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10360691694913307,0.09831277953808748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1056639691320894,0.0,0.0,0.2373895754687689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0860629529553179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07933245733295223,0.08904014799588003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4058222880317508,0.306673831850162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22424929988055414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.280486643536947,0.0,0.0,0.1223912954780942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10232794592760468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23333654052407404,0.0,0.11502473387430436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1011144550834288,0.0,0.0,0.0690533524989083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10852888724298657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08523135770147755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,MarlaBullets,2018/03/02,"I finally asked my husband for help and now I'm afraid I(24f) just came to my husband(25m) for addiction help.

He knows I've used in the past many different drugs, being mostly addicted to pills. If I had nothing I would grab a whip cream can or chug some cough syrup. This is all before I met him in 2015, the year I got clean, aside from some alcohol and very occasional blunt.

I've been ""clean"" by my terms since 2015 until this last October. I was living alone for a short time. It was a very stressful time due to some major life changes. That's when things went downhill. I became a different person. Irritable, angry, narcissistic even. I started drinking heavily and eventually found some meth from a friend. Never done it before. I was hesitant but I needed something like I needed air. Big mistake but I haven't done it since, thankfully I'm not around it. Soon after I felt so empty and even suicidal(thoughts, no plan to actually do it). Made up for the emptiness with drinking until I got hold of myself again and slowed down.

I realize I go in cycles, while I'm thinking clearly now, next month could be different and I can no longer trust myself.

I finally told my husband this past week about my childhood sexual abuse. Our talk went so well, I felt closer to him and it broke down some major walls.

So tonight I told him about the meth incident. My goal was that I would have someone I can trust to go to who can love and support me and know what's happening. Keep me safe from myself.

Although he said he would be there for me, he wasn't happy(to be expected).. But he said he needed to protect his credit and assets that he had worked for.. like I am a threat to our finances. I got defensive immediately. I felt offended, attacked and vulnerable. I told him this and he got angry at me for not understanding his feelings too. I know he doesn't mean to make me feel this way. He is also afraid and takes the most logical route he can think of. But it felt so demeaning. I'm not really sure how to handle it. I want to keep open communication but now I'm afraid he won't understand and I'll feel worthless and build up more walls again. Maybe this is just something I have to accept and deal with but I don't know how to feel.

Ultimately we ended the subject and agreed to talk about it again later. I really need someone's insight.. I don't think he's in the wrong for feeling this way but it feels too far and I feel really disheartened.

addiction,AnonymousStruggler93,2018/03/02,"Not sure if this belongs here but... Hi, I am not sure if this belongs here, but I have come to the conclusion that I am an addict. 

Forgive me for posting this here; I realize that I am quite unworthy. 

It is sad for me to admit, but I am addicted to food. 

Around a month ago, there was an episode that took place where I went on an absolute binge. After eating late in the evening, I proceeded to drive out to the nearest gas station. I bought a jug of chocolate milk and a bag of powdered donuts. I proceeded to inhale the whole thing. It was an odd experience; i—more or less—blacked out during it.

Since this time, I have not been able to stop binging. I have never really had a problem with food or weight, but this episode just set something off in my brain. 

For the past month, virtually every night, I have gone out of my way to binge on food—specifically palatable foods high in carbohydrates and sugars. 

I have wasted so much time and money, within the past month, on this “food addiction.” It is exhausting; I can’t seem to stop. 

My sensual desire for food is isolating me from my family and those around me. I am currently a university student. As a result of this passion/obsession/addiction, I have been unable to focus on anything. I have a good GPA; I fear that my grades will suffer. 

My love and empathy for others has withered during this time. It is so bizarre. My thoughts are constantly about food. My life is searing out of control.

I am destroying my body and my soul. I am absolutely addicted to this garbage; I don’t know how to stop. 

There is no reason for me to be doing all of this. Nothing traumatic has taken place, as of late. This has happened as a result of my stupid decisions. It’s no one’s fault but my own. 
 
Forgive me my fellow redditors. I just wanted to get something off of my chest, because I really am struggling. Each and every one of you are struggling with things of which I am absolutely unable to comprehend; I do not act as though my problems are on the same scale. Whatever you guys are going through, I am sorry. 

You all can overcome whatever you are going through. I want all of you know that I am here for you.

addiction,chronicmcdonald,2018/03/03,"I want to relapse so badly :/ I quit hard opiates on Christmas Eve two months ago. I was using heroin, fentanyl+analogues, and U-4 in the last year after a 5+ year pill addiction I started when I had knee surgery. I've made it through the shitty withdrawals by using kratom daily and phenibut a couple times when it got really bad. All I can think about it snorting a huge line of heroin and my skin is crawling. I feel like I'm losing my mind. Luckily, I deleted all of my connects' numbers so I can't get anything. I took 4g of kratom and did some yoga earlier and I'm starting to calm down so I think I'll make it through the day. I'm just so tired of this. How long do these feelings last? Am I looking at a life sentence of coping until I'm not strong enough to say no?

addiction,MadManCharlies4449,2018/03/03,"Best Advice you Have I’ve been in a cycle of relapse and sobriety with DXM for almost 5 Years now. I’m in the military and got to my permanent duty station so now I’m hitting the syrup pretty hard.

I started going to 12 step meetings again and I really want to stay sober. Well I mean get sober. Again. I need to because of my job. It can be dangerous doing what I do under the influence. 

What coping mechanisms and solutions can you guys offer from your experience with drug addiction? I’m open to any suggestions. I want to prioritize my service again.",1.4757011795543915,4.134173247706425,3.9014744429882064,80.95818807339452,87.1651376146789,7.517955439056357,24.29947575360419,8.418075326091056,2.2988815203145467,440,18,80,12,14,152,75,109,0.042,0.825,0.133,0.8354,1,0,1,0,0,0,10.0,0,3,0,1,7,3,1,0,4,0,7,2,0,1,0,14,19,5,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,3,7,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,2,1,12,2,15,15,1,14,0,0,0,0,7,4,0,1,7,53,15,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2512908145896845,0.0,0.2252525019893477,0.0,0.0,0.2308232854422296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15675525972920407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14051725417535404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2419068804623805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26731936472506684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2254838100322221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12043238760472882,0.0,0.1310046091044411,0.0,0.1843605574677168,0.0,0.0,0.2282419491305965,0.0,0.0,0.2064924145880841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22874641691028266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25109385566026665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17092084959536138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23451237044983425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1476711315757102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16315674230607793,0.2456938598807465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2719225037265655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20725690721214174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14844140819081414

addiction,Lifetimestudent25,2018/03/04,"28 [F] - have you ever wished you could go back to being an alcoholic so you could easily drunk text your ex? But you're sober now and it's not worth it... you think... 
I have.

Do you ever wish you could go back to being an drunk, not because it was a good time in your life, but because you could do dumb and terrible shit and get away with it, or at least have an excuse. Sobriety has been wonderful and it has brought me the best things in life including a great job and a man who loves me. But it's hard to find anyone who understands.

It's like I'm addicted to dangerous things. Addicted to ruining whatever good thing I have going.

If anyone wants to talk me down, I'd appreciate it.

addiction,1abetrap,2018/03/04,"I have a bit of a problem with energy drinks, and in particular Monster. TL;DR: Have a weird dependence on having a can of monster by my side at all times. Destroying my wallet and my chance of dieting.

I always like to pretend like I don't really have an addiction but I drink at least a can of monster a day. I never drink more than 1 can a day, but when I don't have one next to me I just feel like I want it. When I do have it, I'll drink it over the course of 8 hours or so. It just feels weird to go about my day without being able to take a sip. I can get by with other carbonated drinks but I just end up drinking them really quickly and wanting a can of monster. I've had this problem since I was about 15, 4 years. I really want to stop drinking it or at least decrease the volume that I drink, the sugar amounts are insane and I'm pretty sure it's fucked me up hormone wise as I had just started to hit puberty at 15 and I still haven't finished at 19. When I do finish the can and I don't plan to sleep soon I also feel empty but can get by. I know it's not as extreme as a drug addiction but I just really wanted to talk about it.

Edit: just to be clear, I dont think it's the caffeine that's the issue. The other flavours of monster do nothing for me. Just the green one.",1.1406547619047591,2.5576139464285745,3.541428571428572,90.45190476190477,79.17857142857143,6.523809523809526,22.380952380952376,7.333567415737692,0.6893095238095235,995,30,229,13,24,346,132,280,0.102,0.794,0.103,-0.2133,0,0,9,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,1,1,18,11,2,0,19,0,27,15,1,1,4,41,44,21,0,6,16,0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,14,8,10,1,5,9,0,1,8,6,0,2,3,6,30,5,40,38,6,31,0,0,1,1,2,11,1,3,22,166,44,1,0.09302317527077844,0.0,0.0,0.20281798356304706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07439059965569397,0.0774027337564883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1015572146045247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17997675730310986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10902246861689363,0.7290183797813431,0.10787735041055976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0823909225486823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1411059373517591,0.0664557750003534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08599842658235829,0.09720153937802184,0.0,0.052867214226298746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09160908955000367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09709202680301514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05112310436261792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1363392739656726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07174520746567432,0.0,0.09893120222538733,0.0,0.0,0.08925824552122276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12606982204435568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09463801168556152,0.0,0.17802123135980175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23837211229199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07694973185895715,0.0,0.09309035549545563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0658422822443125,0.0,0.0742884279341778,0.07777153982843038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08767324180864929,0.0,0.06994185092662251,0.07476850462739933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059605494602324414,0.0,0.0,0.054242561572950265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21946991568827964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08967102142127972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059903874989778436

addiction,cherrycarnage,2018/03/05,"Feeling helpless about damage done I am a very anxious person, so this may just be me.. but does anyone else feel like they already took too many years off their life and death is going to approach sooner? I can't shake off this feeling. It's like every single day I wake up all I think about is when I'm going to find out my organs are shutting down. Like I said, I struggled with anxiety issues before I even started using. They aren't as bad when I'm high, so I dragged it out a bit in the past. But whenever sober I just constantly think about how life is pretty much meaningless, and one day we'll either forget everything or go to some unknown afterlife (forgive me for sounding emo) , and that just makes me want to get high. I feel like I worry more about dying slightly more than the average person because I abused drugs for so many years. I can't stop stressing that time's going to catch up and I'll find out that I have one of my organs failing, or cancer, or heart problems, etc.. And before anyone asks, yes, I go to a therapist, take the pills I'm prescribed to, all that good shit, but no luck has come out of it. I still feel this feeling of utter hopelessness/doom. The people around me either act like I'm crazy, don't understand, or blame it on drugs (which I already know that using drugs makes problems worse, I don't need the speech). It just makes me feel misunderstood and alone. Any solutions to this problem..?",5.6468496271748165,5.802604517605637,5.799942004971005,83.23486743993372,67.20422535211267,8.372493786246894,29.02982601491301,7.928766900206844,1.7666038111019056,1129,35,223,12,17,358,157,284,0.214,0.627,0.16,-0.9717,0,1,3,0,1,1,39.0,1,0,3,1,18,19,1,3,8,1,16,10,3,6,2,58,50,20,2,5,13,0,7,5,0,2,7,3,0,2,15,13,0,1,14,0,0,11,6,11,0,2,3,10,29,8,32,44,11,38,0,3,0,0,9,15,1,7,17,138,44,1,0.0,0.10327476019159898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0902753311829897,0.19237467448237647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059274321503371585,0.0,0.06668001052078809,0.09847019830440737,0.0,0.12189380539244801,0.08930953608964523,0.0,0.07759419442003583,0.08148631599349196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07277806896900993,0.05313419731592703,0.0,0.14833981895509565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09516021174162216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07508383049086029,0.0,0.09419302050050517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11242678261199857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0904621844581418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0762775625310756,0.08919875256949003,0.0,0.0,0.3032467426515064,0.0,0.07281410705754918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0972105932974216,0.05757081784716572,0.0,0.07343919707314747,0.0,0.07833713506189986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30850818592185164,0.18680934619308115,0.0,0.0,0.15933212983363346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045539448402772936,0.0,0.2476857660755569,0.07310879649770131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10328943298624524,0.0,0.18418652071155064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09097628233481043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047902903353347986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12313263243774562,0.2129189644444095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1745473884462637,0.1767406711289758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06407536655570413,0.06463079712952935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1181287908169452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08320763763643174,0.06042835150127676,0.15221600401466975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0886768435494578,0.0,0.25021173734438384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08291266211238019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08947231042950733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06169493269699498,0.0,0.06960906282923633,0.07287277645773191,0.09984575170348256,0.0911224499240448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06553627302300824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1012038020692608,0.0,0.11170199004391754,0.0,0.0,0.050825868598211366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968421048795598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09074051100224093,0.0,0.1505629437770911,0.0,0.07191920108076907,0.05141142293322155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08851899306631933,0.08882728167884231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1122611613634588

addiction,apriltrainer,2018/03/05,"My 70 yr old father doctor shopped for opiates I found out from my mother that my father collapsed in the bathroom. 911 was called. He had overdosed on Vicodin. Later more pills were found from numerous doctors for vicodin, norco, percocet, etc. My father thought since it was prescriptions from a doctor, it was all kosher.  But he had to have known that it was not right since he had scripts from 5 different doctors!  We wanted him to go to rehab but he refused. His response, ""I'm not a druggie."".  But unfortunately he is, just to legal substances. And I am furious at his main PCP. He wrote him a script for Vicodin for over a year. I had a talk with my father and told him this was wrong and he needed to stop taking them and pursue other pain management options. I think when the doctor finally stopped(without giving him other options!)..he went doctor shopping.  I am still struggling to understand addiction. I had major surgery a few years ago and was given a morphine drip. Out of a pain scale of 10, morphine only made my pain an 8. I actually had them remove it because it was ineffective for my pain and made me too itchy. For dental surgery I  received vicodin, out of 10 it did bring my pain to a manageable 3 but didn't make me this HUGE fan of opiates. SInce it didn't bring my pain to a zero, heck it didn't even make me feel sleepy so that at least I could sleep through the night,  I didn't see the big deal.  So I am trying to understand the draw. Trying to understand my how my father, a senior citizen became entranced with opiates. I want to stay compassionate and want to learn the hows and why. And also anyone else out there with senior citizen parents who have/are struggling with addiction? The face of addiction just isn't usually a 70 yr old.

addiction,Lulumaegolightly,2018/03/06,"I am meeting with my brother tomorrow after I found out a couple months ago he is addicted to meth. His girlfriend left him and took their child after many failed attempts of begging him to get clean. A friend of his girlfriend messaged me tonight saying she is worried for his well being and that he has brought up suicide. He’s gotten clean before from being in jail for 30 days, so I have a glimmer of hope that maybe he can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Obviously HE has to want to get clean, but I’m just wondering if I could get some pointers from anyone here as to how to approach the topic with him. He has a very hopeless attitude and I believe his deeply rooted issues stem from a major lack of self worth. I want to be encouraging but not come across as the sister who everything is so easy for and that does everything perfectly because that’s how he’s always viewed me. Please help!!

addiction,Friendly-Snake,2018/03/06,"I Don't know what to do I'm currently in recovery after a long time using opiates, stims, benzos, my worst was amphetamines, i loved needles. I'm currently a year and a bit sober apart from weed but even that is once every six months and usually not even a full bowl. My boyfriend has never had an issue with any addiction, and he was the one to pull me out of mine and keep me motivated. But the issue is that he uses psychedelics and grows/smokes quite a lot of weed. Last year he took acid twice in a two month time period and didn't tell me until a year later in case it triggered something for me which was rough, he plans to do more in the future and hes only getting into heavier use of cannabis, to the point that it was daily for months but he refused to tell me about it.
i guess being sober and being with someone who isn't. it's just really rough for me and it leaves me feeling torn. i feel it'd be too hypocritical if i said something.
i just need to know whether i'm being crazy and controlling or whether my feelings are somewhat validated, i need an honest outsiders perspective",5.5690045248868785,5.552481194570137,6.150407239819003,81.2460633484163,67.37104072398189,9.15294117647059,30.12217194570136,8.841846274778883,2.1886217194570143,868,29,177,13,13,283,129,221,0.069,0.8640000000000001,0.067,-0.1001,2,0,3,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,4,6,3,0,0,13,0,20,2,0,6,1,43,39,18,0,3,10,0,5,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,12,14,0,3,6,0,0,2,5,1,0,4,8,7,19,2,24,26,6,30,0,0,0,1,12,9,0,5,19,119,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14542190688134934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.090714214209236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14563446047433454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14961555042061994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17621429887111026,0.0,0.11239232918539367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20234787982293806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06969418076164086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14695131615744644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2784626379303388,0.0,0.11856896434191865,0.0,0.0,0.14662248764139002,0.1087359754851961,0.0,0.1412476634710245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11805173058675572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11340895880998192,0.12039557573972448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3194275107604407,0.0,0.0,0.1978236722621384,0.10288362694438412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14206294999268854,0.09039294050659748,0.10145407152473364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12610283765063945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14188362889398992,0.0,0.0,0.08545723241070648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12689064675489606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11302644629226605,0.20539033066623075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2331888923993849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1555691778311244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14820845222189494,0.0,0.0,0.13030902574215794,0.0,0.0,0.3456353135899997,0.14691743078007674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25770897365876605
addiction,goldprismlights,2018/03/06,"Looking for a group for healing from second hand addiction. Hi. Im not sure this is the right place, but I am the ex of an opiate addict. It’s ongoing. Has been for about 4 years. If not longer. It’s been a rollercoaster, and I’m just looking for people to talk to. We are actively involved as we share kids, but I have to do my best to protect them. He’s not allowed to take them, or be alone with them because of past incidents. And, even though we’ve been separated for 3 years, this addiction is just as big a part of our lives as it is his. Just looking to rant, or connect, or find helpful advice. Anything really. TIA!

addiction,Jjohns28,2018/03/06,"I'm a Shopaholic Mainly online.  I spend, spend, spend, on eBay, Amazon, Etsy, you name it.  I'd estimate I've spent $300 on various wish list items on those sites in the last two weeks.  Bad move, because I'm going to have to scrape by hard for a while.  

I've had this addiction for years.  The hunt for that item seems to fill a void, seems to bring some excitement to my life.  I go out to eat, too, seversl times a week, to fulfill another addiction to eating.  The restaurant excursions add up.  Then reality hits, and I've been lucky not to have many overdrafts in the last year and a half (since buying my house), but I'm nervous after doing a little math today.

I'm so angry at myself.  I could have a fairly comfortable life if I watched my pennies and didn't engage in this behavior.  I just feel stupid, and degraded.  I need to seriously look at getting help, and i'm going to do a bit of web searching to see what I find.  

This is my first time posting here.  I feel silly and vulnerable, and hope it's okay I'm wrotong this.  I admit it, I have a problem with spending.  I'm sure I'm not alone.  I needed to vent my anger and fear.  Anyone else have this addiction?

As an aside, I see most of the posts here are about addiction to drugs and alcohol.

addiction,jowig,2018/03/07,"I told myself as I lay in bed yesterday that if I used the substance today, I'd have to confess my addiction. So here I go. The substance is modafinil. The study drug that keeps you awake and alert. That comes in discrete packaging from India, and is great for the whole first month or two.

Being a prescription drug, my usage is technically an abuse from the first pill on. I also exceed daily recommended doses for narcoleptic people. I take it every day.

I want to tell you about the drawbacks: as mentioned, it does make you alert and it certainly also inherits memory and mood enhancing properties. But the by-far-worst side effect is that my heart doesn't feel alright. Palpitations and a general pressure in the heart region is scaring the shit out of me. Then it goes away, and I repeat. Because in the beginning it didn't happen, so that's what I tell myself.
Second, social exclusion. I gain confidence, and my somewhat dismissive attachment personality gets dramatically exaggerated. Resulting in isolation and depression.
Third, sleep deprivation. Needs no further explanation. It keeps me the fuck awake, for hours.

I'm in a high pressure situation at school, but the problem is that the mood enhancement it offers also takes away any stress related feelings I might have. So I don't get the work done either.
I've recently spent a week in my room without seeing other people, although I found that to be a good reflection period. I think it led to this.

Hopefully, by posting this confession, I'll be able to see it in a new light as what it actually is. The first step is taken, now the hard work begins. Thank you for reading and making it real.",4.648738312082575,7.085052763934428,5.761129326047361,73.87811171827569,72.18032786885246,9.239829993928355,29.00121432908319,9.725611199111238,3.224593199757133,1323,54,221,36,27,438,184,305,0.1,0.804,0.096,0.2212,0,1,2,0,1,0,44.0,0,4,0,7,9,17,2,4,23,1,18,10,4,6,1,41,47,24,0,5,6,0,3,0,0,1,5,0,2,1,23,11,0,2,8,1,2,4,5,9,0,6,6,6,27,6,31,37,3,39,2,2,2,1,13,17,2,5,17,155,50,4,0.10584930219678487,0.12541411449720646,0.10329364999865416,0.11539136333831072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2539429461734079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07198115522104873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1988978075196748,0.0,0.0,0.06452475216145702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09117980130478767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06826404322263778,0.0,0.09116784887958894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09262943765826648,0.10832058624008324,0.0,0.0,0.2455031712378622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08918260234376077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10704117521273801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2701060871263324,0.0,0.1160582964160022,0.0,0.09785597424799544,0.11060378325796556,0.0,0.0601565977365592,0.08878137269653551,0.0,0.11669922935281853,0.0,0.0,0.0936021883599281,0.0,0.09482018384653217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25086386549541945,0.0,0.1118355993008617,0.0,0.10513224053594553,0.10424024094559936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1881674465483201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14131046229931155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.112289382404266,0.0,0.0,0.08448790315222543,0.0,0.0,0.07848591636727786,0.0,0.10222991565040557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14676515694635422,0.09242352788031906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10137437205489504,0.0,0.0,0.10128348694181123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10587794652122297,0.12047967926130765,0.0,0.0,0.10451341616436001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10597361705904836,0.10712514484768867,0.1686963789909676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10865278760965473,0.0,0.11897905058109702,0.10592574529693498,0.10790003367267714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12125001803895577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15917100428757688,0.0,0.1850339112336772,0.09745181616054914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.067823958840203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10033276184850584,0.10114354432122033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.103399387741099,0.0,0.0,0.09141981174715233,0.0,0.0,0.06243266089651835,0.0,0.08490592549077668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11817696580620482,0.0,0.10203495007654323,0.0,0.1541191053167283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,Dashashound,2018/03/07,"New here, my addictions have ruled my life. Between tabbacco, marijuana and most recent 7 years ago alcohol, I've lived a life of dependantcy and impulsivness. I've seeked counciling and i dont apply what ive been told. i began using when i was 15, and soon after I became dependant, going absolutely nuts going with out, I have a great deal of anger sadness and issues but I'm also manic don't care for any meds I've been prescribed I'm nearly 31 a trainwreck from hell I once quit marijuana for a only 4 months when i was 23 but I was angry, irritable  and depressed. I've never figured out how to overcome any of this I been told to let go and forgive. I never figured out how to live a happy sober life. Also I'm sure I'm ment to figure it out on my own but after one day of detoxing from.marijjana and my flaring temper I looked up this subbredit searching for advice and anything anyone here could offer me. The hardest thing it's believing in myself which is my greatest weakness.

addiction,exactlyfourtyfive,2018/03/08,"Post treatment and I’m back to Xannax Iv been struggling with 3 friends ODing, and didn’t reach out for help. I’m worried as the last couples weeks I got 15 2mg xannax and they were gone within 9 days, i know it’s shameful but I guess I just went back to my old ways. I’m really unsure what to do right now as I’m all over the place and mentally obsessing about these bars. I got more bars and I want to take them tomorrow, but what should I do? Taper my self down? 
My ex girlfriend has been contacting me regarding all of this and it’s bringing up old feelings that just make me feel super lost and depressed so that’s when it started. I don’t want to go through detox if it isn’t that bad I’m just in the state of getting my bars stocking up but I know that’s my addiction speaking. Any advice or help on this would be appreciated.

addiction,JustmyNSFWaccountTBH,2018/03/08,"Addiction to Clonidine? Last week I was given my prescription of clonidine which was dosed to two .1mg a day. In that week, I've averaged almost 8 a day and I've almost run out. It was diagnosed for anxiety and things have been very stressful, but I've realized at this point that I've just been chasing the high. I'm freaked out, because clearly I'm addicted to a significant level, and, now that I'm almost out, I'm freaking out on top of that because withdrawal from this is dangerous and cold turkey is very much not recommended.

I'm not really sure what to do. Is going into detox an overreaction? Have I been taking enough to where that's necessary? I was thinking I'd taper off with the last 6 I have, two a day. I'm just afraid that won't be enough.

Advice?

Edit: just want to add that prior to this I'd been taking my clonidine mostly as prescribed, with one or two additionally on occasion.

addiction,redvelvetabby,2018/03/08,"Life rules for living with a marijuana addict. Hey everyone
My friend was just telling me about her relationship dynamic with her new boyfriend and it really surprised me.

Essentially he’s been a long time pot smoker. He’s a good worker and it’s never affected his work. He and his friends smoke a lot of it. She isn’t big into cannabis but will take a puff once in a while. She doesn’t love it, but her boyfriend expects her to be kind when they have guests over.

They nearly broke up because he hid when he was smoking all the time, he hid it out of fear she’d judge him.

She tells me she’s always loved him but they needed to establish some boundaries around their lifestyle. For example, they have a special man shed outside that’s well ventilated, he and his friends smoke there. He showers before coming to bed, he engages in no other opiates, narcotics or illegal substances (I should state marijuana is legal in their state), she isn’t to turn her nose up at his habit or friends, she drives whenever he is under the influence. She has kids from a previous marriage, they’ve told the kids it’s for medical purposes. He eats healthily and he takes care of himself otherwise.

At first, I thought her a total enabler. Then I wondered how many couples in North America live like this already. If you give a man an inch, won’t he take a mile? Or do you build a measured safe haven, with freedoms, and encourage healthy living like exercise and diet?

She’s depressed, she’s lost a lot of people in her life from overdose, and she’s unhealthily skinny, yet I still find myself drawn to her. Most people in my life don’t approve of her saying I can do better, but what does it mean to truly be better? Everyone has adversities in their lives, what separates a girl like her from a girl that sits next to me working on her 4 year degree? Should her addiction really be reason for me to ditch the girl and “find better”?

addiction,edible_excrement,2018/03/11,"I am addicted to salami I eat salami sandwiches for nearly every meal and then again as a dessert, and then snack on salami slices between meals.

When I was a kid my parents used to moan about how much salami I ate because it was expensive given the rate at which I ate it. Since I left home and got a job I am content spending a lot of money on it. I buy about two pounds a week.

I think the salami and/or the bread is making me fat. But I crave the taste so badly when I'm hungry. I don't know what to do.",1.6074821610601404,2.956039330275232,3.4232415902140687,92.09084607543323,77.71559633027523,5.945361875637107,20.367991845056068,6.42735559955562,0.08346401630988788,393,9,89,3,9,132,73,109,0.059,0.941,0.0,-0.6799,2,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,0,7,1,0,0,9,0,7,12,1,3,0,10,16,11,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,5,3,11,0,2,0,4,0,1,1,0,1,6,1,13,0,13,10,2,11,0,0,0,0,2,5,0,1,6,61,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.286214184880453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21921516681355493,0.16004576781331087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2686503764196133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22120655391253605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20998223419303028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2633553130358733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26053665895907524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14428856245044502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2852572878595483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22320744790139194,0.0,0.0,0.1752516722741996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19300171558728085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2915265598240126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2171809855700941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16822904707261674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2564695539014489,0.0,0.0,0.22675567862407334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21059877925712084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,Zarco416,2018/03/13,"GROUP - Web Series About Addiction Myself and a few others in Toronto wrote and produced an original web series about our experience with alcoholism and addiction. 

Thought maybe some people here might want to see it. Group is a dramatic comedy about the intersecting struggles of a goal-setting group at a clinical addiction research facility.

Trailer is here: https://youtu.be/BxyZAVdU5BY

It touches on serious issues of addiction and mental health in a way that’s heartfelt, authentic and incisively funny. For us, the ability to see life’s small ironies again and learn to laugh at our own imperfections was a critical step in the long, difficult process we all know too well. Hope it speaks to some.

Right now I have removed all my social media except for Snapchat and instagram(and Reddit I guess) but I feel like it’s really really hard to replace the habit of always checking my phone with something else.
Do you guys have any tips on how to do this?
Thanks, peace.",2.7761050061050057,5.180067978021982,3.6544322344322353,86.87112332112333,78.01098901098902,6.681807081807082,22.1990231990232,7.793537801064563,1.143819536019536,370,11,70,6,9,118,66,91,0.026,0.84,0.134,0.9023,0,0,1,0,0,0,9.0,0,1,0,1,4,2,0,0,3,0,7,1,0,1,2,13,13,4,0,0,4,0,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,3,2,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,9,2,12,11,3,7,0,0,0,0,8,3,0,2,3,44,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2045889781904247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15615721969213653,0.0,0.0,0.1276226449674973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1967693641426211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15677495242357786,0.0,0.1662207104150749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0948920440296311,0.13407212578808278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1961005949327372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2067406504366631,0.3716473857515722,0.0,0.0,0.16811626073014402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09168652029054576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1595510848273019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17973684159186176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2404535634669276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16026991999150186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5739205343579556,0.0,0.14447822471301547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17278214689806387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14898972858959378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,sturnfizzle,2018/03/13,"Manic cravings are so bad I've been doing really well. Exercising every day, eating healthy, taking care of myself. It's only been 12 days clean, but I was really starting to feel better. But then yesterday I hit a manic episode. (Am on medication for bipolar depression.) And all I want to do now is cocaine. I asked my boyfriend if we could do it together, and he was very adament about us staying clean, about how tired it will make us for the next few days, and basically about how it's not worth it.

He's not wrong and I fully recognize that I am being a brat about it. I have been complaining, crying, irritable, and now just kind of moping. He eventually gave in this morning but I could tell how sad it made him so I decided not to do it after all.

I'm just having a really hard time controlling my impulses/excessive energy. And I am super emotional. A night of coke would be so fun. Just staying up all night with my man, making shit tons of music and art, and I feel like I need that release. I feel so pent-up, like I'll burst any second.

But I know he's right. And I don't want to be this way forever. I don't want to be upset with the love of my life just because he is the voice of reason. I am very lucky to have him and he deserves someone that doesn't make him feel bad for wanting to do the right thing.

So I'm not going to text our dealer. I'm going to run until I can't breathe and then hopefully be exhausted enough to actually sleep and maybe eat something.

Just need some encouragement, reddit. Need a vote of confidence that I will keep getting better, cos it really feels like I'm headed for an inevitable crash.",3.1420250231696016,4.586845704819278,4.850843373493976,83.02784522706212,73.87951807228916,8.240222428174237,25.118628359592208,8.841846274778883,1.7965515291936982,1282,41,262,26,26,435,174,332,0.131,0.674,0.195,0.9683,0,0,2,0,0,0,41.0,4,0,0,4,20,23,1,1,10,0,34,14,4,10,3,63,67,28,0,12,14,0,6,3,0,3,6,1,2,1,16,15,3,2,8,2,1,3,8,9,1,1,7,7,31,14,32,49,7,26,0,2,0,1,20,5,1,4,18,170,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.0968451184993052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06748743516363469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09277714747053543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16572455276780226,0.060496528773027414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17554159501498487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1011830415246506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1113074709018983,0.1584720833998143,0.0,0.10901182409809093,0.1920071375701464,0.0,0.08547632045324739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2030970946499728,0.0,0.111633019028404,0.0,0.1025427128134561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08361501110833491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25089672254580914,0.1417958999153839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051849443292151576,0.0,0.11280214875528202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08890064336832862,0.0,0.10185012649080682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09856892745036852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08821015938018055,0.0,0.10334446271172296,0.05454038109951277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0700970111289873,0.14545274692583007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08956907892055425,0.0939044453075126,0.19873286208900648,0.0,0.0997011480171206,0.0,0.0,0.09997509205455757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2207583294195128,0.0,0.0,0.10554416714864154,0.18626233109732002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07547742251638341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2543058761785106,0.10203650644672503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16950292539168185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.101869689874198,0.0,0.0,0.09931289440873227,0.0,0.08408676669271876,0.07640074240241536,0.0,0.0,0.0702434488444785,0.21155587975101128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07461704941245006,0.0,0.08674120364634645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06593145921269009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057868355548567466,0.11406318753597675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23874994544378894,0.0,0.0,0.1637688056769314,0.2341401796849676,0.07877306398219408,0.0,0.0,0.08922977839377083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0704981178642155,0.10850469884074786,0.0,0.0
addiction,EyedBall,2018/03/13,"I’ve gotten addicted and I want to stop. I am not sure if this is the best place to post this, but...
I’ve been addicted to porn for a small time now. No it isn’t a drug. No it isn’t anything physical, but mentally it is really messing me up. I am ashamed of myself. 
It’s affecting my ability to socialize and it’s harming my relationship with my girlfriend. I no longer feel the joy I used to when around her. Everything has gone numb. 
Is there any advice you’d give me to help me stay away from all of it?
Please help me. I no longer want to do this, it’s harming not only me but my girlfriend and my friends.

addiction,AmazingAnxiety,2018/03/13,"My successful way of dealing with addiction. Maybe it can help others? It's a bit silly, but it works very well for me. Every morning, I go out of bed, kneel like a knight and solemny promise, pronouncing the words out loud, that for the day I won't do whatever it is that I shouldn't be doing. 

For example, I might kneel and speak **""I solemny promise that today, 13 of March 2018, I won't smoke cigarettes""**. You have to do this in a solemn, serious fashion, really meaning the words you say. Then, for the day a sense of dignity keeps me bounded to the vow. 

If during the day the the strenght of the vow is fading, or I feel like I am about to break it, I kneel again and renew the vow (maybe if you are in a social situation you can do something more discreet). It has never failed me.",2.199892183288412,4.004024842767297,3.7562668463611857,88.36033018867926,77.30188679245279,7.058580413297397,24.564690026954175,7.957251820313856,1.3214614555256072,606,21,128,10,14,201,94,159,0.018000000000000002,0.8079999999999999,0.173,0.975,0,0,3,0,0,0,30.0,0,4,0,3,3,10,0,0,15,0,17,1,0,0,1,19,21,8,0,3,4,0,1,2,0,4,1,3,1,0,11,6,0,2,2,0,0,1,4,3,1,0,0,4,17,7,18,16,2,16,0,2,0,0,9,4,0,4,11,90,28,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21542079797800925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21573566432514996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3823205023008065,0.20372414019020715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1664924202890493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09991603666743493,0.1411704803422718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1123046120016611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1324518067781228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1756421811660213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1930815974498152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3970455835366739,0.2152519535663527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20962979951163935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15240670054831695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12659210426890372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1571450178293698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2221185475008277,0.0,0.20143545134720706,0.0,0.15212752286760575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18730833049761506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16304647014680204,0.0,0.15685123881628335,0.0,0.0,0.17767242472032074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14386024954765256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,Leonardothedog,2018/03/13,"27 year old homeless guy addicted to painkillers My family made friends with Chris while volunteering at a soup kitchen. He is intelligent, clean and presents well so seemed out of place. Chris says his family threw him out, I suspect due to drugs. He sleeps rough or in shelters or on buses. In conversation he is a bit dreamy but he’s smart and asks questions and appears interested in wellbeing of others. He shares that he takes meds for depression and a few painkillers each day. He is matter of fact about his situation. Not lying, not defensive, not blaming. He had a lot of varied pills in his backpack.
How can you help someone like this? I would guess next steps for him are likely bad, not good. Location is Orange County, CA.

addiction,Ringoateyourbaby,2018/03/13,"Thinking about the possibility that never using again is literally impossible for some people(including myself) I’m about to start my 5th treatment program and I’m feeling very discouraged. I’m afraid I don’t have enough self-control and I will relapse again. I have so many good things going for me(wife, baby on the way).. but it’s always in the back of my mind that my sobriety won’t last. The urges are too strong.
Just venting my current thoughts.. if anyone can relate or drop some advice, feel free. 
Just to clarify, I’m not unhappy with life and I’ve had some wonderful periods of sobriety. They just don’t seem to last and I keep going back to square one. Makes me feel hopeless

addiction,rainnydays,2018/03/13,"My twenty year old so is addicted to Xanax. Looking at rehabs. Advice please. My son has a Xanax addiction. Three weeks ago he had seizures from withdrawals. Today he came home obviously under the influence again. 

I have contacted the American Addiction Center.   They have a place close by to us in Oxford MS.   Does anyone have experience with their facilities. The online reviews are mixed. 

I do not want to put my fragile child in the hands of people I don’t have good data on, but they seen affordable ($250 plus insurance for 90 days) and the online facility search looked nice. However, reviews concern me. 

I need to save my kid’s life. So info will be very appreciated. Thank you so much.

addiction,_throw_away_away_,2018/03/13,"Throwaway account - Addicted to porn/blow? Can anyone relate? Give advice? So for years SWIM experimented with different drugs and masterbating. A few years back SWIM started using a ADHD perscription SWIM had to change over from dayshift to to night shift and SWIM would basically stay awake all night jerking off to porn while high. (it makes it feel better)

2 Years ago SWIM started using mdma and blow. He ended up in the hospital one night and quit for a solid 3-4 months. After that it would maybe happen once a month. 

SWIM is a serious relationship now. On the weekend Swim and the gf went out to a bar and got really drunk and apparently swim bought some blow and after the gf passed jerked off and looked at watched. Swim is concerned because his gf knows this has been an issue and is worried his problem may be worse than he thought. SWIM does not want to lose her but after blacking out and having no recollection of even buying it, that he is a lost cause.

Has anyone ever heard of something like this or have any advice?

Swim can normally go out and have some drinks and be fine.

TLDR - addiction to drugs and jerking off. Can anyone give advice that's been there?",4.334024767801857,6.5583915475113175,4.5372660157180285,83.24976184805908,72.43891402714931,7.186568230531079,24.753750893069785,8.032893268588372,1.4673565610859731,936,29,171,14,19,292,136,221,0.079,0.883,0.038,-0.746,2,0,4,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,0,4,6,10,3,0,12,0,20,8,0,4,2,39,39,18,0,5,3,0,1,1,3,3,4,1,0,0,9,18,3,0,4,15,3,14,2,7,0,1,9,5,3,3,29,25,4,47,0,2,3,1,13,12,0,4,21,103,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2413695487523305,0.13304587879345278,0.3245388904242949,0.09813328969199044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07528318607103103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2322224987023361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08512530009404709,0.0,0.06748473136115578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09790956293327696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11372451473997905,0.11711119522780385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11566314702433295,0.0,0.0,0.09687867844670364,0.0,0.0,0.10844873952294204,0.2567652723073217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09805175777562043,0.0,0.0,0.0731195985432424,0.10013899695950756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10829071800196992,0.0,0.0,0.0559757667548933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2123966184187684,0.06291619420241319,0.0,0.08854088963890361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0978960526726247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11696589483284725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11554724233617095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060840564599083324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0540848637716012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929643056807012,0.1238505610346557,0.12084756859789353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0738964371604836,0.0,0.11121803724603203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17672732576262662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3116673873297407,0.10846738045700816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11789719606048515,0.07501656293874352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10592971965992468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11774837854872618,0.0,0.0,0.07092044818744114,0.0,0.0,0.1188557237617153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08522610604922233,0.0,0.0,0.1567151164304232,0.11799678429843505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0878873922644322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19122712541092846,0.0,0.0,0.06529666845090812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102624630248956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11242628606812426,0.11281783755941928,0.15728329019944856,0.0,0.0,0.21387114230387053
addiction,sukcessfulfailure,2018/03/14,"at a loss here, probably going to give in again I posted this shit in depression and it was buried by the time I refreshed.. i feel it might fit here better. I hope.. its a long story..

Up front, this is a new account I just made for personal anonymity. My entire family uses reddit and knows my real account... Anyway, this is kind of a long story so I will try to cut it down.. I am a 25 year old male from California. My depression started early in life. Apparently, I wasn't going to make it as an child for a reasons nobody even told me about until I was about 21 (but thats a whole 'nother fucking can of worms.) Regardless, this condition had me put on steroids and hgh at a young age which jump started my puberty and make me massively obese. It ruined my entire childhood until around 13-14 years old when I was finally able to shed the weight. I thought this would make me happy, but it didn't. I decided I needed to switch from the private catholic school scene because I was just different, plus, not rich like everyone else. Well, in public school is where I really came into myself. I began making friends with all the wrong people. I got heavily into drugs to deal with my anxiety and depression. Of course, it was undiagnosed at this time. Flash forward to high school. I was a junkie the entire 4 years. I hid it pretty well until Junior year when I just couldn't anymore. I dropped out, finished high school at an adult school and wound up actually starting college early at around 17 (just because it was expected of me, I absolutely hate college..but well get there) I spent the next 5 fucking years at a community college because I was constantly skipping the two classes a week I would take just to go get high. I developed ulcerative collitis, so more often than not, I am in an immense amount of pain if I am sober, and I am in an immense amount of pain for smoking in the first place.

5 years later I finished, after a slew of fucked up relationships, lost friends, deaths, hospital visits, and rehab stints, I finally finished. This did wonders for me. I decided I WANTED to get my shit together, I got clean. For 3 years I got clean. I did it all on my own..well, with a therapist and suboxone, but still. I got myself a job. I made friends at that job. I saved up money and bought myself things I never could before. I've always loved making music so I invested in my musical abilities and was generally just happy, for once in my life, I was content. Well. That didn't last long. At the end of the 3rd year my family decided it was time for me to go to a university. Shit, I even thought it might be. I was so damn confident of my recent sobriety and accomplishments that I felt as if I was finally ready to take on the world. Fuckin' long story short. I'm in my second semester of university. I am studying the major I am best at..and I thought I was interested in. English. I have been writing my entire life, it's the only way I can really express myself because I am the most reserved, anxious, quiet person you'll meet. Turns out I'm not interested in the academic version of it. By the end of my first semester I was picking up again. I was telling myself, I'll stop once it's the weekend, once I get through these mid-terms. Once it's break. Yadda Yadda. Once I have time again, I will get myself back together. This is just to deal, I would say. Well. As you can imagine, it wasn't, it's not. It's a fucking problem, yet again. I've literally kept using since last semester. I can sometimes go a few days during the weekend without it, thank god for suboxone. But..ANY school day. Actually, EVERY school day. I pick up on my way to class, or I don't go. It's basically that simple for me. If I'm not high, I'm not there.

I've convinced myself that I can't deal with school without drugs. And, past experience tells me I can't. I hate it. I hate the system, I hate the people, I hate the shit they try to brain wash me into thinking and believing. I pretend for the sake of saving face, for the sake of everything just going smoothly, when deep inside, I completely disagree with everything. I completely have a different philosophy about life and happiness. I don't feel like this is for me, but it HAS to be, you see. It just HAS to be (FAMILY expectation), or else I have nothing to live for, nowhere to live, and nobody to help me. I type all this and still feel like I haven't adequately expressed what is happening.

Over the course of these past few months. I've ditched class more than ever, my grades have taken a massive hit, my teachers suspect something is wrong with me, my parents accuse me every day, don't trust me again, and all I do is argue with them and demand they believe that I'm still sober. They tell me over and over if I go back to drugs, that's it. I'm out of the house, they're not helping me pay off my debt, I will have to drop out of school, etc.

I stopped seeing my therapist, I quit my job, I withdrew from anyone that attempted to talk to me in the beginning of my semester and I pretty much just get high in the parking lot, nod off through class, go home, do the homework, get high and fall asleep. I've blown through all the fucking money I saved up over the years. I'm down to 100 this week and because I have a massive presentation tomorrow, I'm sure I will blow it today on my way to class.

I'm disappointed to say the least. But, all I can think of is how much worse everything will be if I have to admit defeat, if I had to quit and start over, if I wasted all this time and money and effort. If my family dynamic goes back to how it was, when I was the me before.

I feel like right now I'm a fucking timebomb that can go off in either direction. I don't know which direction is worse, honestly. Go deeper into depression and addiction but come out on the other end with that fucking piece of paper, woohoo. Or just drop it all and concentrate on being healthy and happy again? The problem is, future me will be so upset with me now if I give up. But future me will also have a lot more to deal with if I'm a full blown junkie again. It feels like I'm constantly living for someone else, even when it's all for my own benefit. It feels like my ""here and now"" is a fucking dream and the real me is in this intangible future. If I keep giving in now, I will regret it later, I know. But it's the only way I can get through now. What the fuck do I do?..

I feel like even this is a waste of time. Too long, skips too many details, trivializes the whole thing. Fuck it. Throwaway account.

Thanks y'all. I hope you guys are doing better than I am right now at least.

addiction,Addictthrowaway5212,2018/03/14,"When do I tell a new girlfriend that I'm a recovering addict? She knows I don't drink.

Been on maybe 8-9 dates now. She has slept over at my place 7ish times. We are exclusive as of recently.

I'm a 26M male and never in a million years would she think I'm a recovering alcoholic based on what she knows about me. I'm sober almost 5 years.

I don't know if this is real or not but I do like her a lot and she likes me a lot. I'm afraid of the stigma. Nobody knows except my ex girlfriend and my therapist. 

The reason I'm so hesitant is because this kind of stigma would ruin my life if it became public, just the reality of my career choice and the life I've chosen to live.",0.2593877551020398,2.139554666666669,3.0020680272108846,90.99412244897958,83.96598639455782,6.0968707482993185,17.963265306122448,7.3011,0.18376408163265312,524,12,121,8,15,184,91,147,0.083,0.88,0.037000000000000005,-0.8095,0,0,2,0,0,0,13.0,1,0,0,0,5,5,0,1,11,0,11,6,1,1,1,25,23,11,0,4,7,1,0,2,2,2,4,0,0,1,5,5,2,0,6,1,0,0,4,2,0,1,2,0,18,3,13,19,2,15,0,1,0,0,13,6,0,6,11,75,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1967551726107286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19288346035219603,0.1807295481289975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11002191482884524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1768064826284048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18794724102536245,0.39675910573822937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2549636332730737,0.17635160295930066,0.0,0.15937146607818078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3068836015809774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1813213326112099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13920107508132462,0.17431343315360326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1885682976589895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20543132001694256,0.0,0.18556852846604588,0.1782070567730984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15775175060928162,0.0,0.0,0.2095568702283173,0.0,0.1156474309920607,0.0,0.0,0.1052421918179292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25642257751187875,0.0,0.0,0.2324527057533141
addiction,SmashMouthIsGood,2018/03/14,"Anyone with experience dealing with amphetamine dependence/withdrawal? So I started taking adderall/vyvanse (it was everywhere at the college I went to) as a freshman in college. I felt overwhelmed with my biochemistry coursework and took reasonable doses for a long time because of the edge it gave me academically.

Fast forward 5 years. I've graduated and am applying to grad schools/jobs and I have a script now for 40 mg vyvanse. I began taking pretty high doses a few years into college due to feeling overwhelmed with academics and desperate. I still exceed my prescribed dose more frequently than I'd like to admit, although never more than 60-70 mg in a day.

I've been trying to slowly decrease my dose but end up oversleeping and dealing with depression/feeling totally unambitious on days that I don't take any or cut down on my dosage. I've gone through a multitude of depression meds since before I was diagnosed with ADHD or started taking any study drugs, but nothing helped much or worked well with the vyvanse. I was recently prescribed bupropion as an antidepressant and am hoping that would help, as it is a weak stimulant as well, but have only been taking it a few days.

In short: does anyone that's gone through anything similar have tips for cutting back on my dose, how to deal with withdrawal symptoms, and how long the recovery/detox process is? I really need to get past this, as I haven't been the same person and have been pretty unsocial and lost a lot of friends since I realized I'm probably struggling with dependence.

addiction,Sorella126,2018/03/14,"Sister in codependent addiction Need help/advice. We (my family) just found out my sisters has been sniffing heroin with her boyfriend. We knew that he was a self proclaimed ex-addict. She swore over and over that he was clean and she was helping him and she wouldn’t ever touch the stuff. We found out ( from her) that she has been sniffing it twice a day. Obviously I believe if that’s what she is admitting to its much more than that. She has admitted to being dope sick when she tries to go without it and admits she buys suboxone(sp) off the streets to “self-rehab”. My parents found a place for her to go but she’s refusing to go without her boyfriend. She’s 22, we can’t force her to go. She doesn’t seem to understand that there isn’t a place that will allow them to go together bc of the co dependent relationship. I don’t know how to help her and I’m so scared that I’m going to end up burying my sister.

addiction,jajsur,2018/03/16,"Feeling low Basically what it is, is that I know for a while now that I have a gambling problem, but for the last few months I’ve been getting lucky keeping more or less even with wins and losses. 

Today I lost £1000 and I am feeling really low right now, worst part of it is, is that it’s all been when I’ve been working. I work in a betting shop 5 days a week usually doing a long backshift, and the boredom combined with seeing others gamble, I find it so difficult to shake the feeling when I feel it. 

It’s not that I had the money to lose, but I don’t need it, its no an emergency fund or anything it was just there so I used it but I’m still feeling quite shit right now. 

Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!",2.9792513368983973,3.8620419934640537,4.565264408793823,87.1055080213904,73.50980392156862,7.132263814616755,26.98098633392751,7.348242739294969,1.2546522875816994,567,20,124,6,11,191,98,153,0.25,0.636,0.114,-0.9766,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,7,11,13,1,1,10,0,15,1,1,1,1,28,28,14,0,3,8,0,5,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,16,5,0,1,7,1,6,1,3,10,0,0,6,6,10,3,8,20,6,20,0,5,1,0,0,5,1,5,14,88,26,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17054390570298447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11868305123185033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14361928499609555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11255424998675816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11527218111853108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4412256667275587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15951277761019433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0911821603482897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.192414536463954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15512592587796034,0.0,0.0,0.09591442953111473,0.1422612482701837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15444921957787325,0.0,0.19524894265899845,0.19051476064809325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13930426800589887,0.0,0.0,0.12940814862710734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18899367358230054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16699694847548585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1856289242405384,0.0,0.0,0.11180524662803486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2980869598827117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13907390711449696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17914750490957912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1393759685548391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16542938604043375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15073364921518567,0.1922147385183256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13999350627208088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25411269958006244,0.0,0.0,0.1239776221150007,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,LordStarkus,2018/03/16,"I have trouble saying no to cocaine Hey,

I just wanted to see if anyone here has any good or decent advice for just saying no, it's just that when I go out lately, I've been tempted and have said yes 4 out of the last 5 times... 

My reasons are personal, mostly concerned about my heart over the long term. I've reached a point where George Carlin once said something like...there comes a point where a rational person says ""oh...shit this doesn't work for me anymore, the cons outweigh the pros and if I don't change, I'm going to die"" 

George Carlin is famous for heavy cocaine use, once was doing a gram a day for forever he said, multiple heart attacks (3 I believe) and later died at 78. 

Anyways, when I'm sober I say no cocaine - but when I'm out, it can be difficult.

addiction,SummerBreeze2008,2018/03/16,"A short essay for all of us going through Addiction, and not being able to explain to anyone else what we are going through...no matter which drug...powerful read... That which is ours...

I don’t know to how to cope. Neither do you. No one taught us. It’s like our secret thing. Like snorting, or blazing, or injecting, or drinking, or popping, or smoking...whatever it is. It’s a fucking secret, and it’s ours. And for some reason that gives us power. And it gives us control. Knowing something that no one else knows. And also knowing full stop, that we will eventually all crash down in flames like something.... like the tower of Babel does...in my mind.

Only we’re not thinking about that now...while it is actually cutting us and blazing through us, feeding through our lungs and our noses and our veins, to our hearts and our brains, killing us, we still forge on. Generation after generation, infusing that same rush, that same fucking high as those before us. No one has figured out how to stop that deep need, that deep rush, or give a decent reason why we should, we are all checking out at some point right? Yet here we are. As decades, centuries, and generations roll on, we still go on. It doesn’t matter the season or the year, or what song is playing on the radio. All of the demons are the same. No matter what clothes we wear, who has dated, fucked, or married who, or what is on the news, night after night ....The human needs and cravings are still the same.

It is ours. Ours to keep private, ours to share with who we want. Ours to shout from the rooftops.

But you see a beginning always becomes an end, whether it is a recognition, or a blip in our life, there will always come a desperate need to survive, in whatever fashion, it will just be in the timing. Letting go of that control. Only those who it afflicts that can truly understand that which is scary, terrifying, and endlessly exhausting. That is why we must stop the fantastical suffering of ourselves and our friends. The only finale being death, or wrangling away the hold on our gripped and tangled hands of our impulses.

addiction,Idekaname,2018/03/17,"... Is this an addiction? :/ I'm 17. From the past few months, I have been having these thoughts where I'm constantly thinking of a guy (most of the time this guy is my future husband) where I want to cuddle with him, have him comfort me and hold me and tell me that everything is going to be alright as I cry my eyes out. It's like I'm addicted to the idea of love or something and these sweet fantasies don't allow me to concentrate on my studies. I have severe depression and anxiety, so I tend to cry a lot when I'm alone. I don't have many friends and have never had a boyfriend( all girls school lol), so I guess it would be like to have a really nice person to love me for who am and tell me that i'm perfect... OK I'm ranting. 

Maybe this is the result of reading too many romantic fanfictions, lol. I don't know.

Any advice and clues to why this might be happening would be appreciated.

Also, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this question.

addiction,catalinachalarka,2018/03/17,"Alcohol, Weed, and Binging and Purging. I am scared Iwill get weed Cravings are killing me. Day 3 sober. I want to pick up an 8th so badly but I know I don't want to spend 50 bucks.I dont want to be smoking during the work week. But giving my ed, my drink, and my drugs. I havent been sober since I was raped for the second time in my life and being sober is hell. I am in a perputual flashback it feels and I know weed would help with that but not with my other goals. Ive never been without my numbing and I feel like someone is ripping off a bandaide keeping me containted in sanity. All I do is cry,it feels like im not even human because I have thoughts that I'm nothing but mistakes. I need some tips beyond the normal oh read a book, do yoga. Im putting in my best effort in those activities but the desire to call my dealer is nevernot far from my mind. I feel like I do when I avoid trigger foods, it's only a matter of time. I know a big step i havent made yet is going back to smart recovery. Any just connection is beyond appreciated.

addiction,imoan-,2018/03/17,"I want to reverse things before they get too bad I started experimenting with drugs junior year after my father committed suicide. I looked at it as more of a way of heeling than anything else. Drugs felt really positive at first, they were fun and made the healing process a lot easier. I got to comfortable though and it turned into much more of a habit. First taking mushrooms then acid, ecstasy, dxm and adderall. I think I’ve always been risky to an extent but I didn’t have the same access I have now. I have a constant supply of adderall through my boyfriend and ecstasy/acid are very easy to get, I also don’t have to pay for weed most of the time. 

I bought a 10 strip of something that was not acid (felt more like a psychedelic amphetamine if that makes sense) around September and decided to use it anyway knowing it was sketchy and by the beginning of November it was all gone (I sold about 3 tabs). This left me feeling depressed and even a little suicidal, I’ve felt more outgoing and like I learned a bit about myself but overall it left me worse off then before. I do struggle with depression and I’ve been stressed about graduating and the near future so this isn’t completely new but I didn’t feel suicidal or as mood-swingy before this mini acid binge. 

What I’m struggling with more however is this constant cycle of weed and adderall abuse, I justify it in my head because it’s hard to work and go to school but I know in reality it’s having more of a negative impact then positive one. I do have ADHD but my mom took away my prescription after I abused it, my boyfriend knows I struggle in school though so he encourages me to take his pills. I no longer feel dependent on it because I’m not taking it daily anymore but I do snort it often which I know isn’t productive or healthy. 

I’m leaving for Mexico in a week and I hope getting away from all the drugs helps me clear my head because right now the possibility of that is all that’s keeping me from doing something really stupid. The path I’m going down is the same path I’ve seen a lot of my parents friends and my father go down (he was addicted to heroin before committing suicide) and it feels hopeless and scary and if it’s going to just keep going like this I’d rather just end it sooner then later. 

I guess I just want input or advice on how to turn things around

addiction,Joshuadao,2018/03/18,"Help - Long term addiction treatment Hello,

This is my first post. I'm writing because my brother has been an alcoholic for years, in and out of treatment, and is at the point where is body is shutting down on him. I really don't think he has much time. 

The problem:
He went through the free state-funded program and did very well, but he relapsed after 7 months. At this point they wouldn't pay to have him go back again. He wants help, but literally has no money. He also can't hold a job because he has seizures if he doesn't have alcohol

What I'm looking for

A long term rehabilitation program - 1 Year or longer with help integrating back into society - Ideally out West and in the Mountains. I can't afford to pay for him, so I'm open to funding options. I'm also considering doing a GoFundMe to support his year long treatment program. Sadly, if he doesn't get treatment I feel like he will be dead very soon. Anyway, looking for help in anyway here as far as resources or anything else.

addiction,SecretOfTheOdds,2018/03/19,"The Human Thirst For More We lose everything we'd won, risked, put forth. Every hope, dream, effort, all our work and sweat crushed under the bulldozer of our degenerate instincts, washed away in bitter tears of rage and despair.

&amp;nbsp;

Days of loss grind into weeks, compound into months, building up an everlasting inner torment screaming regret inside our skulls constantly.

&amp;nbsp;

So that is why it is so inhumanly hard to resist that ravenous hunger for more we all experienced. The moment we at last brush with a victorious streak, steal a feverish glimpse at that vision of our ultimate triumph we long held in our mind ; is when the familiar, vengeful, insatiable greed rears its surreal, maniacal visage within us.

&amp;nbsp;

This burning urge, surging forth from our base, emotional subconscious, begins howling its rousing rhetoric of madness at us, melting away each layer of rationality under the rapture of endorphins from success.

&amp;nbsp;

Because of the monumental amount of accumulated trauma we'd subjected our brains to, the voice raging inside demands that our success/'big win' brings nothing short of total, terminal retribution to vindicate us resoundingly from prior sufferings.

&amp;nbsp;

Then, as Reality is far from ideal, this self-destroying aspect of our psychological functioning proceeds to tragically cause us to dismantle the very elements in our strategy that had allowed it to **work** in the first place, overshooting operational risk margins and crashing catastrophically.

&amp;nbsp;

Thus begins a new cycle of hope &amp; despair, one at the very core of the human condition.",10.577456563706562,12.224707911196912,9.90381998069498,52.8888573841699,56.76061776061776,13.270366795366796,44.37282818532819,12.602617957971056,6.741743050193052,1315,73,161,44,16,421,171,259,0.177,0.7190000000000001,0.105,-0.9587,1,0,0,1,0,0,58.0,20,0,0,11,3,25,6,2,15,0,7,6,4,3,3,23,14,8,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,2,0,2,11,11,2,1,0,1,1,2,0,18,0,2,3,6,20,7,43,9,7,37,0,7,0,0,22,20,0,2,15,109,31,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7138762444775993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1768634688325896,0.0,0.0,0.05737655751539417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10507248851970263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0966903331950516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10171361441976544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06070160164887312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10587579926992537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07930275655992185,0.0,0.08459175752191149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08006104595067036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08431579432459384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1869709171680055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07672287473448655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08329596619317697,0.0,0.10529965364297267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09503748192028504,0.0,0.0751281465202493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090465966350704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0903136362388438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06378023667349883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0983385882080138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09461969495202004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0981909026013644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4528739170456461,0.0,0.0,0.15532280097266213,0.0,0.0,0.07549985942029408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0849314421098403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1370454502219459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,eyegotquestions,2018/03/19,"Grandma (71) addicted to Xanax. Want to know how to help/deal with it. We took her into her doctor's office about two weeks ago expressing the fact she needed help because she is taking too many pills over the course of one day. She was also mixing the pills with Tramadol and Trazodone. He gave her a plan to start weening herself off — also told her to walk etc. She wont do any of the advice given to her and my Grandpa just gives her the pills anytime shes asks. We would watch over her more, but she lives an hour and a half away and 90% of the time wont let us come over. She is very distant now and just not herself. It's very sad to see her when I actually get to. She used to be so full of life and just such a hoot. 

My mom and her siblings are getting together to go over there and try to get her to go to rehab. That way she can get off her meds and get help with her depression/anxiety. Has anyone experienced this and have any suggestions or advice? Has anyone been on my Grandma's side of things and have advice? We just want the best for her and want to help her. It's been a tough time and we know my Grandpa will just give into her wants. She needs people to watch her and fix her back up. 

TL;DR
Advice on how to get her to go to rehab. Or advice if you have been in her shoes to make everything smooth sailing.

addiction,vvv6n,2018/03/19,"Research on opioid usage for school Hi everyone, 

I'm focusing my undergraduate thesis on preventing opioid overdoses. 

The overarching concept is a wearable that users would wear to monitor vitals. It would know when the user is overdosing and be able to signal for help.

I would appreciate it if you could take the time to fill out a quick survey strictly for research purposes :) It will take you less than 2 minutes.

addiction,Middleman86,2018/03/19,"Roommate OD last night In the bathroom. We live in a transitional sober house. I think he was already dead when we found him curled up on the bathroom floor. The paramedics gave him multiple doses of narcan. I can still hear their voices, smooth and calloused from experience, “there’s no reaction on the cellular level”. They stopped trying to save him at 1:07 AM. His body looked peaceful in the hallway. Arms out in a T, the tube from the breathing mask still in his mouth though. He was such a nice guy. 39 years, handsome and tall. Laughed at my dark sense of humor. It was hard having to watch him struggle to become part of regular life. His options for work were limited and I could see him losing hope of escaping that misery. I wish I could have, would have tried to do something more to help him. They couldn’t get ahold of anyone last night. His girlfriend showed up to take him to work. We had to tell her. She crumpled up like paper. She had hoped he was getting better. Not sure if she thought he was though. She called his mother. I wish he had been saved. A counselor showed up and the rest of us were told to leave. So much to think about and feel about right now. I wish there was just help for people like him and people like us that didn’t have strings or punishment attached. I wish he could have been saved. Good bye. At 1:07 AM a very nice but sad man found a way to stop the pain but he had to go and it had to be alone.

I’m currently almost done with my junior year in high school and I’ve been consistently turning to coffee for a source of energy. I find myself drinking coffee all the time and when I’m off it I feel weak and super tired along with headaches. I joke around about how I drink a high amount of coffee but I feel it might actually become dangerous and may be fatal.

addiction,ArewaCentral,2018/03/20,"Is my friend addicted to crack, How can I help? I have a friend, who introduced me to crack. We meet up at his, buy a few rocks, smoke, chill then I leave. He's pretty low-key lifestyle. He has a job but after that he doesn't do much and he lives alone. We have a couple of friends in common. Our smoking of crack is private to us and us alone. None of our friends know we do this. So there's no one I can turn to. 

He smokes way more than me; he's told me of nights where he smoked almost 300 dollars worth with another friend of his. Now, when I smoke, It feels amazing and all, but after a couple of hours I never feel the need to smoke another, unless I want to. I just don't get addicted. So I assumed he doesn't either. I have asked him this as well and at the time he told me he had it under control.

This friend owes me money, I'm sure he owes other people money too. He cannot afford to be smoking crack left and right... He has rent, bills, food etc. to pay And I have told him, as long as you never borrow money to smoke, you're good. 

Tonight he called me telling me there was a small sharp thing in his throat. That he couldn't breathe, that he feels like his throat is closing and he would not be able to breathe soon and was vomiting blood and would need to go to the hospital. He asked me for cash and I said I did not have any, but offered to come to his and drive him to the hospital. 

He explains the full story: He smoked on sunday, and some of the metal 'filter' got into his throat. Since then he has vomited, pooped a little blood (red) and been spitting blood (red). Also, he still feels the prick of the metal in his throat. 

At this point I am suspicious. I think he might be paranoid and he's okay, but I would rather not be proven wrong and risk his life. 

After waiting at the first hospital for close to 2 hours, we still hadn't gotten an x-ray or any closer to figuring what the hell is going on with him. Now I know he can get paranoid when he smokes, so I ask him if he had any tonight and he says he had not. 

We leave the hospital and head to another hospital.

I call the mutual friend and tell her what's up. Not the crack thing, but everything else. She tells me that when she was at his, she didn't see blood in his spit, but he claimed he did. This sheds more doubt on him, at this point I suspect he is just being paranoid. 

2 hours have passed and even though he told me his throat was closing, he's still here. Now he's restless, pacing up and down. I tell him to calm down and relax, so he could breathe easier.  The whole time, he intermittently goes out to make phone calls. Some, to borrow money, others to call his debtors, and some of his doctor friends. Although not to much luck, a lot of them are asleep or not picking their calls. 

I keep insisting an X-ray be done
1. to clear my doubt
2. to have a clear idea to what is wrong with him. 

I suspect maybe the metal filter left a small scar in his neck and that, coupled with the paranoia is making him overreact.

Then one of his friends loans him some money...

30 minutes go by and this is the first time he is considering that the filter in his neck might be an injury. 

20 mins go by and he asks me to take him home, that he would use his car to go to the national hospital. At this point I am exhausted and battling these thoughts in my head, but I take him home. 

We just parted ways before I sat at my laptop to type this. 
I don't know what to do... I suspect he might be borrowing money to buy crack. Am I over reacting? How can I help him before he does something dangerous? Should I have left him to drive himself?

I am so confused right now.. any advise or help would be appreciated.

addiction,jagste,2018/03/20,"Road to addiction This probably won’t get any traction.  I’m prescribed 1-1.5mg of clonazapam (klonopin) if needed at night. The last few night I took 3 k along with OTC sleep meds (doxylamine) at twice the dose and cough medicine at twice the dose because I wanted to be knocked out. 

Tonight I took 6mg of klonopin, 6 times prescribed dose, 3 doses of doxylamine (75mg), and 75mg of some generic Tylenol cough syrup. Ido this mostly to deal with depression because the clonazapam helps with anxiety and they all make me feel dizzy an uncoordinated and sleepy and mimic the effects of alcohol.

My worry is that I might have an addictive personality and that I might get dependent on kpin. I really don’t want to tell my parents or doc since I’d lose their trust.

I guess I’m just looking for support and help before it becomes a big problem.

addiction,djohn50,2018/03/20,Question about NA I attempted to go to my first NA meeting tonight.  I have been addicted to everything at some point but currently was using alcohol very heavy.  I have suffered from a panic disorder for more than a decade but I thought it wouldn't be right for me to use a klonopin before even though I really struggle with public situations.  I ended up not getting in the door.  I also want to quit using klonopin through recovery.  Does anyone have any advice?

addiction,adictionhelpaccount,2018/03/21,"How do I get over an addiction? This is not your typical addiction. I’ve never done drugs and I never drink but I do have an addiction to other things. Idk how it started, but about two years ago, after everyone was asleep, I started alternate between three things generally. Masturbation, Internet/Netflix and video games. Its become a daily thing when I don’t have plans during the evening. I never let it get in the way of my plans, and I have an A minus to A average in the gifted program at my school so I do well academically and I still spend time with family and friends and wake up early twice a week to go to band practice. The problem is that im getting less and less sleep. Now on average I get 3 to 5 hours a night. I still have enough time in the day to have “me” time and go through with all my plan and still get a solid 8 hours but i always get distracted doing other things. I am CONSTANTLY tired and im still going through my growing years so i need lots of sleep.  Whenever I try to cut one thing out, the other two always take over. I’ve tried taking melatonin to make me tired. I started taking 3mg and worked my way up to 6mg (which I think is a lot for a child) but I’ve given up on it as it seems to have no effect. So what i really need now is a way to get over my addiction to staying up all night. Or is it even something I need to get over? I still do well in school and have a social life i’m just always sleep deprived.

addiction,Exozalen,2018/03/21,"Can I Help My Family Member? I do not expect personalized service. I do hope for links and information on what to do and how I can help. My addict is a real person, who is killing themselves as I type this. I knew this person at a time. However since this recent escalation they are unfamiliar to me.

A family member who previously did meth which hurt his teeth. Some years went by and now we are in the present. This person renewed his interest in meth. It's not just meth. It is alcohol, the soft drug ganja, and then also meth. 

I am 1,000 miles away. Can I really fly out there and say HEY do this differently? I think, I am wondering if his flat mate is the drug dealer. It seems obvious to me. If someone asked me who it was I would say YES it is his flat mate!

My family member is killing himselves. They are doing it right now. I had talked to this person for years. But suddenly they have been non sensical.  

What legalities exist? I am poor. I can fly out there I can take this person and try to force them to a point but this is kidnapping.

Is there a thing I can use to go to him and say hey there is a nice new life here. Lets follow it. And then I can hope he will say ""Ok yes"" and we live happily ever after?

addiction,e1879,2018/03/22,"Pregabalin for benzo withdrawl I’ve been using benzos (at start mainly etizolam 100-200 1mg blotters and 100 0.5mgclonozolam pellets, about 80 0.25mg flunitrazolam blotters, then 30-40 yellow msj diazepams and about 20 blue msj diazepam blotters). Started with goin on binges (with week or 2 breaks of the etizolam and clonozolam then probably about a few week break to getting 100 0.25mg flunitrazolam blotters abused them on and off with few days and probably bout a week break in between probably more, then got 60 yellow msj diazepams as well as 50 blue msj diazepams, that was about 2 weeks ago and I’ve had a binge on them. I’ve built a pretty strong tolerance able to take 6 blues and feel nice but not at that this is great point like it used to be and even at that no one would have a clue I was on them. I recently acquired 10 300mg pregabalin and have experimented a bit and they seem to make me so drowsy I couldn’t imagine being able to function on them with my job unless I split the powder into 4 and  took 75mg at a time, have a job on a building site so have to be alter still (during this time I never took anywhere close to any amount of any benzo that it could of possibly put me on anyone else at risk while doing my job) I’ve experimented with 3 so have 7 300mg pregabalin left and was thinking of going on 75mg of them a day and maybe taking even half that dose at some point if that would be what would be necessary, I would rather not let anyone see me experience withdrawal symptoms but my main is it causing me to be a danger in my job and especially seizures in case I were to have one while on scaffolding worry’s me I could take one and fall off. Maybe I’m over reacting but I just want to be on safe side.",6.365047233468284,5.765223387464392,6.7765602039286295,79.38164642375169,65.83760683760684,10.010556305293148,31.294197031039136,9.414487439383343,2.489441025641026,1383,45,285,23,19,451,179,351,0.037000000000000005,0.889,0.07400000000000001,0.8573,4,0,0,0,1,0,21.0,0,0,6,2,13,8,1,1,13,0,30,2,0,5,1,52,49,31,0,10,10,0,1,1,0,4,2,0,0,0,12,22,0,1,4,0,0,5,5,2,1,4,9,7,24,6,52,25,8,56,0,0,6,0,6,29,0,4,20,179,36,4,0.18446840399329234,0.10928244711770246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08176005497672764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12544484040654946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12898459717613864,0.09450483967928043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10069586013145873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09474993253080828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1472830102579975,0.0,0.0,0.1189668598853702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07704984053389881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12183964107461676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2706682437254423,0.0,0.0,0.04663638385719067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04818856371694782,0.0,0.052418822532713134,0.0,0.07376811709142145,0.10168853331663953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3661128540433203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10021273034298883,0.0943157205999453,0.0,0.045060972166062585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061567046043077486,0.0,0.1853233060499652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07113670263800399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18750084693851096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17438226723113567,0.1039802043077112,0.0,0.09383534222475697,0.298332209179851,0.0,0.0,0.09272084826416112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0910701472546498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07349871738893853,0.08396655342338265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13056768580011704,0.0,0.07365835285829743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09586665171970987,0.2080459236402316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059099952385604976,0.0,0.0,0.10756500982409747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20495118430937573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15932147323004903,0.0,0.0,0.05440212204339403,0.0,0.2959388534416377,0.0,0.0829296244773418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09366830928230248,0.0,0.2620821230795262,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,Mind0Matter,2018/03/22,I feel like I’ve lost everything So I was dating a girl for about seven months in a relation that started off with us drinking heavily together but then when she would drink she would act crazy and I didn’t like it so I asked to stop and she did but the problem is I didn’t. She wanted me to stop to but I couldn’t so I hid it from her for a while while also using other drug. A few nights ago I got drunk and she wanted her charger back and (we weren’t broken up yet) and I was also on Xanax and drove to her house mad because she didn’t want to see me (because she knew I was drunk) so I went into her house to give the charger back she wanted me to put in the mailbox. After going in I  accidentally fell down the stairs and broke a picture frame while her family was there. I apologized to them and they are understanding but I will never get here back. She was my first girlfriend and now she’s moved on. I’m only 21 but I feel like I won’t meet anyone else. I was so hammered and bared out that on my way home from here house I was going about 80mph on 30mph roads spun  out and got in a bad car accident and totaled my car. I didn’t hit anyone fortunately instead it was a tree. I got a little fucked up because of it and had to go to the hospital  the day after and stayed the night. I have an addiction to alcohol and Xanax and it lost my car and my girlfriend. I feel so hopeless right now. All I want to do is get more fucked up. I missed a week of college because of the crash and I feel so lonely right now I don’t know what to do. ,0.7041361940298501,2.470204782089553,2.7232602611940315,94.18414412313436,81.77611940298506,5.739738805970148,19.42397388059701,6.770275591412753,0.02534514925373177,1202,30,283,13,32,404,156,335,0.214,0.746,0.04,-0.9966,1,2,4,0,0,1,18.0,2,0,2,3,23,14,3,0,18,0,27,11,0,1,3,50,61,37,0,9,5,0,4,3,2,4,5,0,2,1,9,23,5,2,7,4,0,12,9,11,0,2,23,5,53,3,41,32,4,61,0,6,1,2,26,21,2,0,29,203,62,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10680985256790304,0.0,0.0,0.0868510734530146,0.104708067847166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15670501879716453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1370161838423544,0.10038944781760303,0.0,0.0,0.091595664085258,0.0,0.0,0.2260157704194876,0.08180705529246869,0.23890450952172976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06318733206160282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19196114736919184,0.11362270436128374,0.0,0.081847564335145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08805578974884984,0.0,0.09236439419352042,0.0,0.19816131489230396,0.13999018046379488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08333954555181268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18115709668275976,0.10237831880536777,0.09398887148978348,0.16704848134232825,0.0,0.2350844856142018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09827934338783588,0.0,0.0,0.3391583726954989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05384582909125838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14360045885143752,0.09819911696702263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2139078612335672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07820464390392026,0.10413449449730684,0.0,0.0,0.07556622837126452,0.0,0.0,0.18389034774264293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0745162448654431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09375116122080096,0.0,0.09849437118784568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16734436700132185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07807532057636285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0693489239534142,0.10443089610557862,0.0,0.1638270247464766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10199795221261107,0.11785477566115107,0.08462103516248948,0.0,0.0,0.28894811157695405,0.07776991753029527,0.0785915784461515,0.0,0.0,0.0908260522786491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13920069971076346,0.0,0.0,0.0

They were and are prescribed by my doctor because I have severe migraines and nothing makes them go away. But the truth it that I don't need the painkillers ad often as I take them. Not at first. I do now because I get shaky and sweaty. I've gone a month before without but that's the longest. Today is now about 3 or 4 days without because I ran out and I haven't called in a new script. I don't want them but my skin is crawling and I don't know what to do. I've already torn up the house looking for something and found a single oxy belonging to someone else but that would also mean that I no longer get to live here.

addiction,Afuckindragonyo,2018/03/23,"Why do I hit the self-destruct button when things are going good? I don’t get it. I had a good day at school. I was relaxed and confident and funny and had no problems talking to people. Then for some reason I had the urge to use. I could’ve just stayed the course and gone to a meeting, or even gone out tonight and tried to get laid or something. Why do I do this? Am I trying to fuck up my life? At this point, I think this has to be the case.

I’m also wondering if other people here do this? I wasn’t aware of it for a long time so maybe people here do and just don’t realize it yet.",0.4117441860465121,2.0035792635658893,2.4149031007751947,96.89584302325585,81.94573643410854,5.230232558139536,18.501937984496127,5.985473137389443,-0.4105457364341083,451,10,110,3,12,151,77,129,0.066,0.807,0.127,0.8253,0,0,1,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,0,9,5,1,0,7,0,16,2,0,2,0,19,27,13,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,9,7,0,0,4,1,0,3,4,2,0,0,7,0,11,3,13,18,1,16,0,0,0,1,2,5,1,5,7,77,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14749170913126608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14725544758489748,0.0,0.0,0.118944596321752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1218168398961802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17050615236250316,0.19271818266566654,0.0,0.10481802565559446,0.3093887803228888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13027110550595133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16321818213937792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18528862448218952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38358969502029744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1743496331790633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17647831712901094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18962874853993847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866569354566453,0.0,0.0,0.19240476289153352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1419862133054952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19658197894297652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14824096845198673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12252967624329812,0.1181777847362517,0.0,0.0,0.107544880012807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2504369992003703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15929165766831674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3328457840442086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20001067805382414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,littlecakebaker,2018/03/23,"Someone please help My husband and I have been together around 5 years, but married just 6 months. He's been clean almost 6 years from heroin. He has a lot of issues dealing with his emotions and handling tough situations appropriately. I know that he leans on me a lot for those things, and I knew things might get rough when we started dating, but we've been able to manage so far. 
He started drinking after we'd been together about 2 years? We live together, but he works nights so we spend an astonishingly small amount of time together. Basically Saturday and Sunday. I didn't really notice his drinking becoming an issue until about a year ago, when we were starting the process of house hunting, but apparently he's been drinking more and more for some time. 

We bought a house in July and then got married in October. Since then things have gotten progressively worse. We got in a huge argument one weekend and he smashed one of my cakes, which I feel has done irreparable damage. I was actually scared of him. He put multiple holes in our walls, smashed his face on the toilet and puked everywhere. A couple days later he apologized, and said working nights is making him miserable and that he was going to stop drinking. I have suggested more times than I can count that he find another job on the day shift, I feel like then I could help him with not drinking, but he refuses to even look for another job. He just keeps saying something at his current employer will open up eventually but it's been 5 freaking years of working nights and I'm so tired of not seeing him. 

I don't know what to do. I love this man, and I've tried to support him the best I can but I am starting to resent him and our relationship is crumbling. I know he can beat this, but not if we stay on this same path.",4.416366944979664,6.1574927283237,5.061535003211309,81.59848319417685,71.13872832369944,8.362920145579105,28.710768572040248,8.94667605116694,2.324602354956112,1428,55,272,28,27,459,187,346,0.117,0.7879999999999999,0.095,-0.8388,5,0,6,0,0,0,32.0,10,0,0,6,11,10,1,2,12,0,28,8,1,1,0,56,52,31,0,2,14,1,3,1,0,2,1,2,1,1,13,24,5,3,7,6,2,2,5,6,0,2,17,7,38,4,35,31,9,52,0,2,2,1,46,16,0,6,34,171,51,7,0.08701637798144128,0.0,0.08491543264645729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07713476881273443,0.0,0.08713433305865617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18248851882260905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07746302494693641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09610275295089203,0.0,0.0,0.09131832020762518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06947549723106197,0.09628196715850397,0.0,0.11223673022537732,0.08971006482253069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08904796611615913,0.0,0.4262146147036456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09788171314484101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05747349698573584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08799619051406661,0.062164517816636074,0.0,0.0,0.07953139304043283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04546246602674756,0.0,0.049453412900070576,0.0,0.13918989313833402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11665048786886845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2008104342960771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1816449820957545,0.17270065659838535,0.07734415491096458,0.0,0.0,0.14346577699115567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04251180691470485,0.0,0.07683705597156,0.0,0.07307184186960494,0.0,0.0,0.1479564256493953,0.07853567847447168,0.0,0.05808410799586072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09231062595412176,0.0,0.0,0.06945564272011573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2449769282534371,0.0,0.0,0.09906872307254087,0.0,0.0,0.11792909944357448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09551785249573658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08747549395621687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0557449199166129,0.0,0.0,0.09342302498168888,0.0,0.0,0.08277250201040555,0.06919891635251657,0.08711857448929655,0.0,0.0693407872027728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07198084706868699,0.09781005469445817,0.0,0.0,0.07372869468485553,0.0669894590057028,0.0,0.0,0.2463625608244147,0.09274788103071968,0.0,0.07274958832796655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09874515454260734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17342944499875845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15221984930446064,0.1000125258633552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059078408744333816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19004687859164746,0.0,0.08867712318023613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.280178472380152
addiction,skankopita,2018/03/23,"We think my sister is using again. Advice?? My sister in her early 20s was addicted to opiates and used most any drug under the sun except heroin. I‎ts been 13 years since she’s used. My other sister and I don’t know what to do.  

About a month ago she met a guy online and within a week they were dating and saying I love you and were spending every minute together. My sister however has a 7 y/o daughter and lives with my mom and I. So my mom and I got stuck babysitting almost every night and after work she wouldn’t come home just stay with him. Annoying but whatever. 

Then a week ago she says she was drinking (now I’m questioning that) and her and the bf fell off a second story balcony she cracked her skull and has two fractures on her face. She swore she was never drinking again. That night we were blowing up her phone bc her daughter was really nervous and she sent answering. She called my mom and lied and said she was in the hospital when she wasn’t. And the next morning I forced her to go to the er with me but didn’t want me to bring her. And then was mad at us bc we thought he beat her. All she wanted was the bf and thought we were out to get her 

Now last night she didn’t come home AGAIN after work and said she was getting dinner with coworkers and then she never came home. My mom was spamming her phone and nothing. This morning she texted and said she had a bit too much to drink and was on her coworkers couch. So my sister messaged the coworker and asked her if she was with out sister and she said no. 

So my other sister called the sister who we fear is using. And said she sounded high, groggy not herself. She couldn’t even talk fully and make coherent rebuttals against all my other sister was saying and stuck to the lie she was with the coworker. 

What do we do? Do we drug test her without her knowing?? Do we confront her? She has an explosive temper and is a compulsive liar. We are always walking on eggshells with her but we are terrified. What would someone who struggles with addiction want their family to do and say.

addiction,sirdogglesworth,2018/03/23,"Cant stop thinking about crack at times. I started smoking crack fairly regularly with a friend a while back which lasted a good few months. I've distanced myself from this friend now but I still see him from time to time. I hardly ever smoke now maybe once a month but even then it's a slim chance unless I see said friend. I'm glad I've cut down and it's stopped being an issue for me but I find that every now and then and especially around payday it comes into my mind and it dominates my thoughts till I can snap myself out of it, and even when I do my mind could just as easily just snap back thinking about it. It's really annoying a knocking my confidence on me staying away from it. Does anyone have any tips of tricks to helping me stop thinking about it?",2.957115384615385,4.6876230448717955,3.764358974358977,89.4473076923077,74.96153846153845,6.594871794871796,22.256410256410255,7.321109707123232,0.6678102564102564,609,16,127,7,13,194,97,156,0.066,0.736,0.198,0.962,0,0,1,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,0,16,8,3,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,1,28,16,15,0,1,6,0,1,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,12,10,0,3,5,0,0,1,1,3,0,0,2,4,17,5,22,12,1,31,0,0,2,0,6,7,0,0,22,88,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09724408376153164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0999880818620658,0.0,0.0,0.12729924443186305,0.0,0.0,0.13435207447721242,0.21991449205565386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12318079931078665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11417290133067495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12513920854371086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18889870996266805,0.12935059627973516,0.12048265168509037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1306983073485182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3314415412567659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11994060412691265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12809883186703405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0958490775340064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14925358899596744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11656310314924916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1436615092185639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2887760357378695,0.0,0.2282805466442049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15228904895361747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09160868932191356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13602459977360096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2279030498814177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10121528261622327,0.15241768812868808,0.11419902184697202,0.3586601852905883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27488356004739656,0.0,0.11352506955379428,0.25015124076633743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,Jaylovespie12,2018/03/23,Opening up about my problem. So I've gotten into a rather steady coke habit. Over the last 6 months. I knew it would be a problem regardless when I picked it up but when you don't care if you live or die. It's hard to really consider the full consequences. Anyway I have been battling with my mental health for at least 10 years and it's just killing my chance at living a fulfilling life. I know I need to get off blow but I feel so ashamed at the mere thought of opening up to my family of how I became the exact person I didn't want to be. An addict. Would it be better to just tell them or get some support from another source before opening up? ,2.0232222222222243,3.8255404518518494,3.39453703703704,90.7629166666667,77.81481481481481,6.5740740740740735,22.36111111111111,7.492282038375204,0.7860000000000005,511,15,110,7,12,167,90,135,0.204,0.728,0.068,-0.9626,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,2,1,1,10,8,2,1,8,0,9,4,0,2,1,29,20,11,2,9,8,0,2,0,0,2,3,0,0,1,5,6,1,0,4,0,0,0,2,5,0,0,5,2,15,3,21,10,3,19,0,0,0,0,5,14,0,4,5,76,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2046042781064536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19680401468499745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15970605261714724,0.0,0.0,0.16599206939925226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19135729568087265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19478732672995205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1769326493985271,0.0,0.09489914040558596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1961152600562557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1681288330822571,0.0,0.0,0.19950030509059435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2076455682953676,0.0,0.10314672968260508,0.15298826872420082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1325674172552638,0.0,0.0,0.3314584652085055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18914226646275809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14980832129097296,0.0,0.0,0.13916599817586894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16387924238803095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3591782630919574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1202357727342558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2129826355110727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1640449022262777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1490008705893083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11070143504194216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666519800514423,0.0,0.0,0.12086294206009432

addiction,aloneindankness,2018/03/23,"Fighting to be clean Hey all,

Today I have exactly 3 years and 3 months clean.

I did it all on my own. I just reached a point and stopped.

I also quit caffeine, because it was affecting me so heavily. It was making me want to use again.

3 months ago, I went to an NA meeting. My first meeting in 6 years. It was really triggering, and I had to leave halfway through.

I have been doing alright I guess. The hardest period is long gone. Sometimes, it just hits me, though. I quit of my own volition, which makes it much easier, but sometimes I want to slide back and enjoy myself sometimes.

I know NA/AA are the end all be all of solutions, but honestly I can't go back for a lot of complicated reasons, the head of which are the panic attacks that happen. Also, they tend to make me want to use more.

I know about Life Ring, but I have similar problems with them

Does anyone have any other support resources?

(I have already done outpatient and inpatient rehab too.)

I need to be influenced by something whether alcohol, weed or coke. I know that I shouldn't have these cravings and I beat myself up for it because I give in to my cravings.

addiction,AlexT__,2018/03/24,"I can't stop cracking my knuckles I don't know if this is the right sub for this but I have a very very weird problem and somehow I need advice if someone's gone through this.

I've always cracked my knuckles, but it's never been this bad, it's a habit that is now built into my brain it seems and I can not stop myself. Every 5-10 SECONDS I'm making a fist to crack my joints even if they hurt or don't need to be cracked, like my fingers are actually in pain and I can't stop doing it. It takes so much concentration to stop doing it and I end up doing it anyway as soon as I stop focusing so hard on it, I do it all day.

The part that's difficult to combat is that it's really easy to do so anything I'm doing, in flexing my fingers to try and get a satisfying crack out of them, and if I don't do it for around 20 seconds I get a massive uncontrollable urge. I have to sit on my hands or somehow put them in a position where I can't crack them to prevent it, and obviously that's impossible to do for enough time to kill the habit

Has anyone experienced anything at all similar? How can I deal with this? It's just so easy to do that as soon as I bend my finger a little bit too much I've basically relapsed.",2.8521969696969687,3.3404361893939414,4.924696969696972,85.87787878787881,73.46969696969697,7.836363636363636,26.78787878787879,7.984000788550335,1.4020015151515155,950,32,218,13,18,331,128,264,0.149,0.7490000000000001,0.102,-0.9572,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,4,0,16,9,1,1,10,0,26,6,5,2,4,40,37,24,1,7,10,0,5,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,23,11,0,6,2,0,0,2,8,8,0,2,2,6,28,1,31,34,7,29,0,1,0,0,5,14,0,9,13,158,51,0,0.0,0.0,0.1329277019215142,0.0,0.0,0.13310923474205733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11334308048237915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09524577794588518,0.0,0.22418922612603412,0.12126160780404123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11373512827883375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14871319125110358,0.0,0.0,0.15206271771067262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08784840490750773,0.1404332803171155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1206474308108009,0.14074810764146384,0.0,0.08996974563522613,0.0,0.11476831713363625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14233504898411636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12202327185319935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14582263253149175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15070342882128548,0.0,0.0748610527182517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06654852506293643,0.13652476702875202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09092560390284883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20026967293758485,0.2020056895277172,0.10505859973356904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14494401164894408,0.0,0.0,0.1475092478850739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13034084052551226,0.0,0.1369352545662892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08726380903181268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1163281881959378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1240064298735398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11541583955575233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5694156698485751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10241789215872783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07942896488998942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09248209498337663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22478583662656884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,MYKETYKE,2018/03/24,"I'm happy to spend money on drugs but not on things that will improve my life TD:LR I can't stop buying MDMA, Xanax and pretty much anything but I won't spend money on a gym membership

I can't stop buying drugs all the time, pretty much all the money I get goes to drugs, I have heroin in a baggie in my room and I can't decide what to do with it. I want to get better, I want to go the gym and get my life on track but it seems like there is this voice in the back of my head saying just keep doing drugs. I want to stop. I was in A&amp;E 12 times in a year for things related to drugs. I've nearly killed myself countless times. I want to get better before I go to university. I lost on what to do. I can't tell my family. I just want to get healthy. I can manage a drug habit so why do I find it so hard to get a healthy habit. I've got to the point where I'm scared I am going to end up accidentally killing myself or pushing my self to suicide.

This is my first post to this subreddit, although I have been a lurker for sometime on my main account. The past couple of years have been a roller coaster ride, but not like the good ones you find at Six Flags.

Before I begin, I am an active user and did not come here for a pity party, but rather some insight. Drugs of choice: Alcohol, Cocaine, Marijuana, and Nicotine.

Cocaine is the big problem, but alcohol is the trigger. I used to hate stimulants, but a couple of nights out with friends mixing the two was the catalyst to a pretty catastrophic love/hate relationship. Cocaine and alcohol have driven me to set back my life a solid two years (and still going). It used to be a good deal worse than it is now, but I keep using that as a poisonous rationalization to continue my habits.

In the past couple years, I completely trashed my credit due to these substances (780 down to 500) after applying for and maxing out many credit cards with cash advances to supplement my habit. I quit a miserable job, lost another and fell into a vicious cycle of essentially doing the bare minimum to survive and supporting my habit all while digging myself into an abyss of seemingly insurmountable debt.

I feel pretty broken at the moment. As a college graduate with a privileged upbringing, I know I need to be doing more. Friends and peers have long since passed me by and are now settling down with families, buying houses, and chasing the American dream and all the while I am sitting here jamming the accelerator in neutral.

Addiction is a crazy occupation. Even though I know it's counter-intuitive and is destroying my life, it still has a firm grip on me.

I'm struggling to put an end to this and I am disappointed in myself.",6.1424497569946155,7.581187516616317,6.635297517404437,73.12329436490215,66.58308157099698,9.74443714698542,33.42453697622488,9.971965246562196,3.5579934585577293,1432,63,240,33,23,466,192,331,0.17800000000000002,0.706,0.116,-0.9761,2,0,7,0,0,0,48.0,0,1,0,6,10,19,4,2,29,0,23,8,0,5,2,47,40,24,0,3,8,0,2,1,2,0,8,0,1,0,9,22,3,1,6,2,6,8,2,10,0,5,6,2,28,9,43,32,5,48,0,4,0,0,5,15,0,2,23,175,37,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2242322147072279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32972972136851714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10784183127669128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07908136990093817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08751342399072358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0885917636798971,0.10783090735993996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3413877341200352,0.0,0.0,0.10602856263869012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11926741788056497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09109004394139317,0.0,0.0,0.06792807793943532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0969530065446804,0.0,0.05200146503262565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0939983635661354,0.08747980838142512,0.0,0.0,0.15891540922508596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05844911936854647,0.17252282362004553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10153803391337536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10866126973827228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11866919143010572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10205768116492292,0.0914132610419668,0.0,0.0,0.11304172058662725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14528477040787433,0.05024481691387244,0.0,0.0,0.09101448869422092,0.0,0.0,0.1122673431207949,0.0,0.0928215258898265,0.0,0.0,0.10426857331946192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07625818060041055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0965129595872277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0696903571077178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1963541636503636,0.0,0.0,0.10745101754275656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09849697283573322,0.2092604470564155,0.0,0.0984086673958757,0.0,0.10338751742778482,0.0,0.10938819679883496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11041692006089313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09362612258117632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08507435333266494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10171622302362378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1642641192872406,0.0,0.0,0.10751580595754097,0.0,0.0,0.11670715905065855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10104457934887176,0.0,0.05996968069212118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2009290213911554,0.0,0.0,0.2664748850754229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10480772618250428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1986862060630942

addiction,JayMaya,2018/03/24,"I love him even though there is no future (starting a family) for us. How do I explain this story... I will try. I had this boyfriend in middle school and we were IN LOVE. He wrote me love poems and we had a very deep relationship. At 14 we had to break up because we went to different high schools. He stopped talking to me over night at age 14. It was the hardest heart break I ever went through, mind you I was also going through puberty/hormonal changes. 9 years went by where we haven't talked or have seen each other - we weren't even social media friends (I blocked him from everything at like age 15). We matched on a dating app as 23 year olds and FELL IN LOVE. I am talking about psycho-attached. After a week of us meeting we were officially boyfriend and girlfriend, a week later we met each other's families and were talking marriage and a life together. Yes, at age 23. Love is relative because we actually loved each other from age 11-14 (maybe even more).

Maybe 3-4 months after we started our second life together, I noticed some weird things about him. This led to him having a seizure and the a couple days later he was in rehab. I came to learn that he is a drug addict (his DOC is Xanax and Addrl, and even weed... but I have come to learn that it doesn't matter the drug, an addict is an addict). His disease caused him to get evicted from his apartment, sell his car, caused him to not keep jobs, etc. etc. etc. After rehab he started his march to sobriety, but I still felt like something was off. I knew it wasn't easy for him.

OK TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORTER, I had to walk away. He started to not be so responsive and make excuses. The only thing I could form in my head about his behavior was that he relapsed, or he's not well, or he's about to relapse. I realized I had to walk away and force my broken heart to heal, than stay in a toxic relationship with him facing heartbreak each and every day. I have come to learn that I would never be #1 in his life, but the drug will always be. The drug will always be priority and his real true love. Addiction is one hell of a disease. The sad part is that he told his mom we are still together and everything's fine. I had to tell her the truth. When I found out he was lying about the status of our relationship to his mom, I knew this disease was a motherfucker.

I hope to share this story in hopes that someone can understand how I am feeling, maybe someone can even relate.

Thank you so much for reading. Addiction sucks, but what even sucks more is the ones that are ""addicted"" to the addicts. In other words, the ones who LOVE the addict, who are in love with the addict because we see through the addiction and know they don't want to be that way. &lt;/3",3.2498811653462814,4.753097712454213,4.209345770508563,87.49960771786354,73.70695970695971,7.130351818723912,25.701337422267656,7.738981096181357,1.2917691115086467,2125,71,440,28,43,687,248,546,0.087,0.7829999999999999,0.13,0.9778,3,0,5,0,0,0,80.0,17,2,1,0,24,27,3,0,30,2,51,34,4,7,4,85,94,30,0,5,10,2,2,2,2,4,21,0,0,0,25,38,0,3,12,1,1,12,10,6,1,4,30,4,67,21,67,54,13,74,1,2,2,9,82,26,3,6,34,303,92,7,0.0,0.0,0.0493441971059345,0.5512337086512382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040436854184826856,0.08414834865976305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09501506257467844,0.0,0.0,0.09247195995808047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05783294933230019,0.0,0.1038884753254539,0.05349112081759917,0.08711463071973949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040372079874757084,0.05594926878600253,0.0,0.06522055139052127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052829717599479006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23455763005472074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1691801992876983,0.20038644156279645,0.04573898485533085,0.0426032375516602,0.0,0.0908892173980184,0.0,0.0953364625725908,0.0,0.025567209834375267,0.0,0.04855038002218319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05544197009404548,0.03906643409973404,0.0,0.02641815291556751,0.0,0.028737284585972776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05189433184350732,0.0,0.0,0.11983966125627185,0.0,0.053424754139619744,0.0,0.10044501282047454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05017801225246756,0.0449445419516189,0.0,0.0,0.027789230442486896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.107146775819489,0.04940706098648473,0.0,0.0,0.044748480239038914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41073240634179065,0.0,0.06750513032426299,0.0,0.15239817480774864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051056288509998105,0.11844235662337382,0.04036054245604484,0.0,0.03717113164872148,0.0,0.03899888569492886,0.0,0.0,0.047451876364542483,0.0,0.0,0.05756864737035109,0.053059516600998544,0.0,0.10279256454530708,0.03845700094551531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05475702428743474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05057873608283656,0.057554099800008925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1628638287031595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1023490652607398,0.04029380013241952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05154470317730976,0.08568720972169623,0.03892744776982805,0.0,0.0,0.14316081755664087,0.05389561802966957,0.08076263242662099,0.042274648011000164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16256909519369805,0.04419608459627247,0.04655350667751682,0.0,0.0,0.06718634804285364,0.0,0.0496799073106488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04831707454469995,0.0,0.034330351444155235,0.0,0.0,0.052640002884794916,0.12164706440102042,0.0,0.0,0.0417214638814447,0.02982457803713888,0.04013618503449568,0.0811204700953691,0.0,0.04546405478158067,0.14062293066423406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035919962486433525,0.0,0.0,0.06512447188970491
addiction,Dannyl223,2018/03/25,"Florida Involuntary Treatment Guide Hey all!

I've developed a resource for everyone who is curious about the Florida Marchman Act. It is a Florida statute that allows for involuntary treatment of a substance abuser. The website has everything you would need to know, so I won't elaborate further.

I've taken the time to gather all the available information from the state and other experts; so that people may actually be able to focus helping the addicted individual, rather than waste time and effort trying to find out HOW they can.

I hope that you all will find it a helpful addition to the addiction community.

addiction,Throwawaysamaze,2018/03/25,"My best friend is doing too many pills My best friend takes way too many pain pills, and for the last few years, I’ve been helping pay. I occasionally endulge, but not daily and no where near the extent that she does.
She means a lot to me, and I’m pretty much in love with her. She’s just amazing, and over the years, I’ve developed feelings for her. Just seeing her makes my day better. She’s a lot like me, and we like a lot of the same things. I’m sure she knows I have feelings, but it’s not the time to act on it.
She spends all of her money on pills, and then when she runs out of money she asks me for it. It started out as me just being a cool friend and as we grew closer it became me wanting to look after her, I wanted to make sure she had enough money to get by and make sure the withdrawal pains wouldn’t make her sick. Anymore, I think she only talks to me when she needs something, which is still almost daily.
The last month it’s been getting really bad, she’s always snorting away now. I always knew it was bad, and I knew it was getting worse. Today I found out since Friday she’s gone through 250mg. In 3 days she’s taken 250mg, I’m honestly surprised she didn’t over dose.
I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m going to lose her no matter what, and I can’t even think of a scenario I’d consider a “happy” ending. Either she’ll stop talking to me and loose interest in me if I cut her off, and possibly save her life… unless she finds someone else to pay for her or starts stealing. Or I’ll keep paying until she over doses and watch the love of my life die knowing I paid for it.",3.4887096774193544,3.7233444838709713,4.608079178885634,89.63211876832848,71.90322580645163,7.138416422287391,23.41788856304985,6.574015621080383,0.483696774193549,1243,27,283,8,22,409,172,341,0.126,0.659,0.215,0.9864,1,0,2,0,0,0,35.0,2,0,0,4,11,27,1,0,14,1,16,11,0,4,4,64,54,25,1,5,12,0,2,2,3,2,9,0,0,0,14,19,0,2,12,0,8,5,8,7,0,0,12,7,53,20,42,39,12,42,0,1,3,2,39,16,0,7,22,183,67,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09786373042631698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1626404595058121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19384627924633174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09136552674894896,0.0,0.09182172724269064,0.0,0.16320302436193074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20512583635126186,0.08643534928678598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12605714332275386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1014296085558564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08552527617439737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08164191944324335,0.0,0.08656088003676096,0.10098250728653864,0.0,0.06455056942805203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0988317138000512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08932459268034956,0.0,0.0,0.10715727207508152,0.2265207658057979,0.0,0.15318163450320554,0.0,0.0555429220472247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1040367337818733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06550719732491955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08686802619080809,0.0,0.0,0.1611316186400739,0.15932802683664285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13806094539306274,0.09549310508948716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08206963642755595,0.10933627095945796,0.0,0.2492628435827924,0.17641253905965534,0.0,0.2609454752185217,0.19816829756975785,0.0,0.10645798301918287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07800815197807656,0.0,0.0718437144398755,0.0724664841200518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07432902017226196,0.20798588283353506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11017730088678462,0.0,0.09942781708253236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06260914181421026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07787915357994046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08084430058867742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08280737165298288,0.0752382915827877,0.0,0.0,0.13834936467251982,0.0,0.07804830313352003,0.08170770178456516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2763316418315965,0.0,0.07348173779740275,0.15710535479818655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06492830039000022,0.12524447859544266,0.0,0.0,0.0569878782754067,0.0,0.09263779834323237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11528884770252552,0.07757451786979676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995964939795888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1258714425406144
addiction,Xanturrya,2018/03/25,"Relapse and renew? I had a pretty serious addiction to cocaine roughly two years ago, ended up in the hospital for knee surgery, which kind of forced me to clean up my act. Now, after only a year of being clean I started using again, and have basically been developing an alcohol addiction to ""excuse"" my coke usage.

It's gotten to the point where it's affecting my life heavily, ruined my relationship, interfering with my willingness to get a better job, and I actually want to get better but I am afraid to ask for help from anyone because that would require actually admitting to people closest to me that I relapsed.

I'm scared.

I want to quit everything, I want to be healthy. I want to save my relationship.

If I had a car I would try to do NA, but I really do not want my family knowing that I fucked up this badly again.

I guess basically I am just looking to find someone to talk to, I need support to do this.

addiction,umstad,2018/03/25,"Help me find a way out I'll get right to the point. I was smoking 2-2.5 packs a day every day when I was 16 (awfully young, I know). I decided to stop smoking a year after that, at 17, and in order to substitute it, I started buying these chewy sweets every time I was craving and walked to the corner store. I enjoyed it in the beginning and it made the cravings ease. Fast forward another year, and now I eat 4-5 packs of sweets a day which makes it around 50 pieces a day. I've gained a shit ton of weight because of it, because of how much sugar it contains. I know I need to stop, but if I did I'd probably end up smoking again.

addiction,buurtboer,2018/03/25,"Dopamine receptor recovery advice needed.. Hi,

After a drugs, alcohol, porn, sugar, coffee &amp; social media addiction your brain is pretty fucked up. I can tell, because this question is not asked for a friend, but for myself.

I stopped using al i mentioned above.

Alcohol since 01-01-2017 Drugs since 05-12-2016 (1 relapse 5 weeks ago) Nofap Reboot since 15-02-2018 (fucking happy that I still going strong despite the strong cravings) Sugar is still in the process ( now only two times a week) Coffee since 25-02-2018 (only relapsed 1 time) Social media since 12-03-2018.

I started using cold showers every day, I do a lot of cardio, I meditate 25 minutes a day, I do intermitting fasting (eat only for 2 hours a day) and read a lot about dopamine receptor recovery..

I really REALLY want to get my live on track and will do my best to reach that goal..

Just have a couple of questions regarding recovery. Since caffeine is not good for dopamine receptor recovery i wonder if green of white tea is good?

And what can I do more to recover !

I know it’s not only about dopamine receptor recovery, soooooo I hope y ou can help me.

addiction,braverthanbelief,2018/03/25,"Interview in treatment facility, a year after getting clean myself. I have an interview as medical support /nursing in a detox/treatment facility on Monday. I have over a years worth of clean time, did proper inpatient treatment, medical monitoring, haven't had relapses, recovery is going solid. 

I guess what I'm wondering is, am I over looking the potential triggers it may cause? If patients find out I'm in recovery will I not be taken seriously as medical support? 

Looking for other suggestions/pros or cons to this as anyone that has been in treatment facilities, or worked in mental health/addictions after getting clean.

addiction,maxwellstrachan,2018/03/26,"The effects of cryptocurrency on addiction Hello, I am a senior reporter at HuffPost looking into a story about the effects of cryptocurrency on addiction. 

It is my sense that the rise of cryptocurrency makes things harder for some people with substance abuse issues. Personally, my childhood best friend became addicted to synthetic drugs that he purchased on the internet -- he tried to stop but could not get away from the internet, which, in turn, made it impossible for him to get away from his supplier. I want to know if he is alone here, or if there is a larger story that deserves to be told. 

However, considering the secrecy surrounding cryptocurrency, I am finding it difficult to report. So I wanted to reach out and see if anyone had any thoughts. 

Thanks so much.

addiction,mrshaokahn,2018/03/28,"5 Days Clean but uncomfortable and feeling that I will fail Hey there,

5 Days clean from any unhealthy behavior! I am going to the gym every day ( already lost 5 pounds), got a new job and I reading self-growth books a lot. It seems that I can finally do what I want to do (during the day). 

But when I get home and prepare myself to sleep I keep feeling that anything can break this good cycle. I keep thinking all the night that this life is It's so fragile and I will fail soon.

Also, I am too afraid and uncomfortable of the good things (it makes sense?).

addiction,bobmcveezy,2018/03/28,How to deal It's kind of hard to say what the underlying problem is but most definitely I am an addict of the anti social schizophrenic type is what I've become but I know I'm not helpless because I don't have an urge to use everyday I want to be responsible and dependable and trust worthy but the urge to use does arise after awhile and I just wonder what methods along with meetings I can use to help.  I believe that some of the actions I do while specifically look at porn I do while I'm sober and that in essence gives me a type of high even though it's not as intense as when I'm using but it kind of holds me over but i think that after awhile gears me to want to use again even though it turns out bad everytime cuz i hear voices while I'm sober and high that gets me extremely paranoid and delusional everytime and yet I still do it at times.

addiction,atabadore1999,2018/03/28,"Relationships Hey guys, I’m not really sure if this belongs here but it’s the best place I could find and I really want to tell someone about it so here it goes I guess.

I’m a senior in high school and I was dating this girl on and off since the end of my sophomore year. She was amazing. I love her so much and cared about her deeply and she was the first person I ever felt this way about. After about 7 months of dating, we ended things, but I couldn’t help but go back to her because she was good to me. But once we got back things changed. She started getting more angry, we started fighting a LOT more (pretty much everyday) and she even started to physically and emotionally abuse me. We’ve been dating for almost 5 months this time and she’s broken up with me about 5 times, but I couldn’t help going back to her each time. But yesterday I finally ended things for good. And I need your guys’ help to keep me away. It’s important to stay out of toxic relationships and I feel like relationships are addictive in a sort of way, which isn’t a bad thing, unless it’s a bad relationship.

addiction,Kelekona,2018/03/28,"The homeless guy. So yesterday I went outside to smoke and going through the ritual when this homeless guy comes along and he's really staring at me.  I tell him I don't have any money on me and he indicates he'd like a cigarette.

I will give one up when asked because of Kharmic exchange.  I also make a bit of a show about how that was the last one in my pack.

Today he wanders down my street again and I give him the half-smoked cigarette from my mouth.  I also warn him that I'm going to say no next time because I don't want him constantly bumming cigs off me.

Maybe he's an angel trying to show me that I should quit.  One was that he showed up on the last cig of my pack.  Two was that I got disgusted when he didn't flinch at the half-cig.",2.405754716981132,3.4516870125786165,3.8265566037735854,91.22775943396229,75.10062893081759,7.3125786163522015,23.94182389937107,7.793537801064563,0.9448654088050316,581,17,134,8,12,192,91,159,0.058,0.925,0.018000000000000002,-0.575,1,0,4,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,1,9,2,1,0,10,0,10,1,1,2,0,10,21,11,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,2,6,6,0,0,0,3,2,4,4,1,0,4,6,2,23,1,19,12,1,25,2,0,1,0,18,10,0,0,12,84,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27257330572915583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11589300898757925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15932184649741316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20777570627214254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18605701414911094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14680372244166784,0.0,0.18416596419094144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32696920111899624,0.19370984254797208,0.0,0.136302282809976,0.0,0.0,0.3374897443011513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27783384321915866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08325972810529236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11375820954110055,0.0,0.17121210807913922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18124605094690502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34644768599488845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1812650952437767,0.0,0.0,0.10917689019478156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13552665433043495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1489566030981175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09937461445120008,0.0,0.16154041477869074,0.0,0.0,0.11570555584277288,0.0,0.16647782514728565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10051948886036884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15798318079375048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,canIbeMichael,2018/03/28,"I'm addicted to productivity, I'm hooked on Caffeine and weed as a result I have 2 morning coffees, and hits in the evening. 

I dont find this bad for my life, but its definitely addiction. I work all day, work all night. Ive accomplished so much work, and I believe I'm doing a good thing.

To give you an idea, I've been doing this for ~4 years, and in the last 1 year I've been extremely productive, running a few organizations and currently starting a bank.

My friends call me 'the exception' to stoners.

I dont know how to feel about this. I cant really stop, Ive taken tolerance breaks which is fine, but if I want 14 hours of productivity, I cant do it with just air and water.

addiction,hmmIponder,2018/03/28,"Dealing with addict family members and my own issues as well? Just a preface: I have been an addict, and still struggle with issues on a near daily basis. I have ADHD, and my passion/problem recently is that I study too much and think too much. I used to solve my problems with substances, and while I may have dialed it back, I still slip up. Now I'm overly anxious from low self-esteem issues and Adderall (regulated doses), but all I care about is getting mine and my family's lives back on track. I don't have much of a filter, and come off as vindictive. I'm working on my wording and tact, but I'll admit my sense of urgency towards improvement has been a bit ridiculous. I'm tired of all of our shit, mine included. Read further, and you'll see why we all need to change. I want to get fully sober, and lead a lifestyle where I don't even need Adderall to handle my symptoms. My family needs the support more right now though, there's more than just the adults' lives being affected now. I apologise for the text wall.. 

I have some addicts in my family. It's extremely complicated, and some of the addictions go back before I was born and are ongoing.

My grandma:
-former alcoholic
-former meth addict
-had a coke habit and who knows what else
-had a dark past full of shit that still blows my mind to hear about. Really bad shit.
-now has diabetes, sugar addiction, a heart condition; she's really not doing well.


My older uncle:
-former meth addict
-former and current off and on alcoholic
-didn't do well on coke from what I've heard, but also, who knows what all he did.
-was very abusive towards family, caused PTSD in some family members
-occasionally still abusive when he drinks, less violent, but overall unhealthy

My younger uncle:
-was around for a lot of the bad times
-binge drank alcohol for a while
-egotistic and 'holier than thou' in his approach towards addiction..
-weight problem, possible binge eating disorder
-PTSD and compulsive lying; fights tooth and nail if called out on anything

My cousin:
-wasn't around our family from ~3 years old til 16
-was possibly molested at a young age, is a sex offender **and is possibly continuing the cycle in our own family (big part of the reason I'm asking for advice)**
-has had many addictions, some current
-seems to struggle with his own identity
-lies to his SO about talking to/trying to hook up with women
-lies to family probably just as much
-has been offered help, seemed to want it, then got worse

Myself:
-former stoner
-former binge drinker/closet alcoholic/currently struggling to fight and understand/explain addictive ..roots (lack of better word) to family and sympathize
-former meth user, short term but no better
-current Adderall user (prescription, and yes, responsible about it)
-potential drug counselor in the making due to my fucking family's problems and my own

So there's way more to this than the bullet points. I think ADHD runs in the family (I pushed to get myself diagnosed), bipolar for some of us.. some PTSD, some I don't know what else. We have problems. We all complain about each other.

I've been doing research off and on about the ego (decent understanding of jungian philosophy), taoism (mediocre understanding), tidbits of religion (I'm agnostic, life is too confusing as is), a plethora of other random things, **but my main interest lately is addiction and its source.** How to help people who are addicted. I struggle with my addictive behavior, I've settled down a lot. I'm almost clean, I rarely get drunk anymore at all, I'm a nicotine addict, but I've been vaping for two years and got family to switch.. not relevant. We're doing better bit by bit. I'm on Adderall for my ADHD, and I'm not abusing it. Pat on the back lol. But I'm trying to help my family see where they could improve. And also see where I can improve.

My grandma is getting better, but I still see her addiction in her personality. She gets dark and dissociated at times. Not always considerate.
My mom loves her creature comforts. Doesn't drink as much as before, but alcohol and smoking has done damage. When she drinks, she eats badly, and I'm sure her pancreas and liver don't like it. Same with my grandma.
My younger uncle is extremely overweight, and my grandma seems to enable it. He's stagnant a lot. Not getting better.
My older uncle, I don't see him a lot. Calmed down on his drinking a little, but that's not saying much. He's gotten a lot heavier since getting off of meth. There's a pattern.
My cousin drinks **at least** a 6 pack a day. I think he's still on coke. He lies, cheats, and steals from all of us. **He might be molesting a family member, and he's really testing everyone's patience. Some of us won't give up on helping him get better and breaking the cycle, but others are giving up.** He needs help, it was just brought to my attention tonight that the potential molestation is happening.. Nights when he's had everyone turn on him and he's disappeared, as much as I hated the things that he did.. **I know it came from the dark side of him that's been hurt, rejected, done wrong, damaged.. This is what I want to understand more.** It affects anyone with addictive tendencies, **some obviously not as extreme, but nonetheless it can be destructive towards everyone.** I don't rationalize his behavior, but I'm trying not to judge because he needs help. Alan Watts described Carl Jung as having a hintergedanken **meaning a thought far in the back of your head, that no matter how terribly someone has behaved.. it could have just as well been you.** I want to further understand this mentality. I'm seeking it, I will be looking deeper, and I know a lot of it comes from personal experience. Does anyone have any insight though? I want to be more understanding of addiction. I feel that I'm getting there, **but I'm guilty of not truly feeling emotions as deep as I should like other addicts. I'm still an addict. I probably always will be. I want to help others though.** Any insight is greatly appreciated, and if you're stuggling with anything like I've described or even worse.. I wish nothing but luck to you, and good fortune. It's a journey, and you'll find your truths.

TL;DR: I'm an addict, my family mostly consists of addicts, and I want to break the chain. My cousin is really fucking up, and I don't want to turn him away. Everyone deserves a happy, fulfilling life. I need advice to help others see the error in their ways, but also to see my own errors so I can help others while/by helping myself. If you have an addiction problem, or have family/friends that struggle, you're not alone. You are loved and appreciated, people just aren't always mindful. We'll get there. I love this community, and hope we can help each other grow by spreading information.

addiction,FuckedNose,2018/03/28,"I'm addicted to cocaine and its ruining my life I'm a university student with a promising career unless this destroys me. I started using coke after a breakup and death and its been 8 months now. I went through my bank statement and I spent $22000 on it in 8 months.

4 months ago I could stop whenever. It gave me a boost on exams and more enjoyment out of social activities. Now its become the centre of my life. Whenever I need a break from the world I pickup an 8 ball and stay in my room with no food for two days. I know its unhealthy. I used to go to the gym 5 days a week now my focus is gone. I just got a look at myself in the mirror and fuck I am thin. I used to be quite muscular but now I look strained. My eyes look tired and dead. Look at my nose below, its not visible in the pic but I'm developing scars on the side of it from the thinning of the walls. It droops down now I wonder if its always going to be too long.

addiction,BlackDogBae,2018/03/29,"Forgiving yourself years after getting clean For about three years I had a daily painkiller / morphine addiction. For that whole time I was dating someone who was the right person in every way, but at the wrong time. Towards the end of my drug use I left her, pretty much so that I could continue using drugs without having to worry about impacting someone else. Now, four years after getting clean, I still regret leaving. I dream about her and think of it as the worst mistake I've ever made and it impacts any relationships I've tried to have in the future. She's married now, so no chance of getting back together. Anyone have something similar? How do you forgive yourself and let things go even years after this stuff has happened and everybody else has moved on?

addiction,SomethingUnoriginal1,2018/03/29,"Clean for 2 years from opiates, but need painkiller for wisdom tooth extraction. To make a long story short I became addicted to painkiller that I originally started taking for pain, spent six months trying to get clean on my own and relapsing because I couldn’t handle the PAWS (relentless anxiety, depression, and insomnia every second of every day that I wasn’t taking painkiller), and then I went to rehab and was put on medication to help with the PAWS symptoms. 

I haven’t touched painkiller (or wanted to) since rehab and I’m no longer on any medication. My life is exactly what I want it to be. I’ve been putting off having my wisdom teeth extracted because I was concerned about having to take painkiller, but I need to do it soon. I’m not worried that I’ll relapse or take the prescription all at once, or anything like that. I have an old hydrocodone prescription from getting LASIK that I am never tempted to take. However, I’m worried that taking painkiller for several days (even at the low doses they prescribe) will cause the anxiety and depression and general awfulness of PAWS to return once I finish the prescription. 

Has anyone else had to take painkiller for a period of several days after being clean for years? What can I expect?

I hadn't thought about before but I probably had about 8 or 10 really close friends over the years and every single one of them is dead with the exception of a few who are doing very long prison sentences.  It doesn't really affact me but it kinda blew me away and put me in an odd state. I know everyone in this group has probably experienced lost, but has anyone literally lost everyone? Thankfully I have family and my girlfriend or I'd be completely alone ",3.18882181110029,4.912061075949371,4.7588607594936745,82.59125121713731,74.31645569620251,8.912171372930867,25.44498539435248,9.466822959209583,2.232755988315481,622,21,126,16,13,209,102,158,0.172,0.7240000000000001,0.105,-0.9134,0,1,1,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,1,6,3,8,0,0,6,0,14,3,0,0,0,22,23,12,1,1,6,1,0,0,4,1,3,1,2,0,4,10,0,2,2,0,0,1,2,3,0,1,9,2,18,5,20,12,4,18,0,3,0,0,9,9,0,3,7,79,22,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1430095817171424,0.0,0.0,0.11628642290564185,0.0,0.0,0.13586673627727908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1834533675375794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12325139176339768,0.0,0.0,0.07996835768339174,0.14488207515310347,0.11162765507078497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13754359941420025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08460262523260413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1521314282682633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11052791377665497,0.3760549025933381,0.0,0.0,0.12366830457681942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2027043815391214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10491957794656163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13158793361684112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07209512334696015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09265891733277096,0.0,0.0,0.11583759857018168,0.11609343443674745,0.0,0.0,0.4296074710182735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15364074812973846,0.0,0.0,0.0964351037610398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08889346102838762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2828764034216738,0.0,0.0,0.13187583810315626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16807925743582933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12478572661711322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21935087185016908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12077631343895355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10414519371574632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21648056004816205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19100657231465373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08447799307561067
addiction,CameronMcCasland,2018/03/30,"Question. Where do you go to watch videos about addiction and recovery? Question. Where do you go to watch videos about addiction and recovery? I have a new video series that is sponsored by a treatment center but isn't inherently an advertisement for them. I know the rules say no post from blogs and I didn't want to post anything here that wasn't allowed. But that got me thinking, are there any other subs or places on the web where people seek this kind of stuff out? I get the reasoning, and im happy to send a link to one of the mods if they want to rule on my particular thing, but id love to hear about the kind of stuff that has been helpful for people in the past.",2.730343137254902,4.675615661764706,3.4932352941176497,90.20372549019608,76.20588235294117,6.886274509803924,23.098039215686285,7.793537801064563,0.9430215686274516,534,16,114,8,12,169,86,136,0.039,0.852,0.109,0.9277,2,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,2,2,0,8,4,0,0,10,0,10,3,0,2,0,19,20,9,0,3,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,9,5,0,0,6,4,0,3,4,0,0,1,4,4,10,4,21,16,0,16,0,0,2,1,11,9,0,4,2,76,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3415370754191169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10652544752161858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12890727402227609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08184168115221882,0.0,0.17805239372960405,0.0,0.12528505214759802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16675382571628394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17655274579256602,0.0,0.10499729632789673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16920582480433985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.326247844878229,0.08608918816573853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1413801871856074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15129081328736846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10614817671297157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1495374491285132,0.21719884845247955,0.0,0.1636629524008281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3000493759014562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3509613624388127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16105938070434894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12457211724655948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35864706516551204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10406941946090836,0.10037318164668377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1847891193616822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,indigox47,2018/03/30,"Help, my brother is addicted to heroin So where to start... well our dad is an alcoholic... luckily for me, he stopped drinking when I was 5, or basically too early for me to have any significant memories. My brother, who is 5 years older, wasn’t so lucky. I think our childhood definitely had an affect on him as he started getting in trouble at school in like 2nd grade. Anyways fast forward to middle school he was a stoner, drank in high school and still got in trouble... but things really took a turn once he graduated high school (barely). In his first few years out of high school he developed an addiction to Xanax (yes, an opiate). The dude crashed the 4runner my late grandpa passed down to him and he had no recollection of driving. Another few years down the road and here we are today. He has been in an out of rehab twice and is still addicted to heroin. Last I heard he actually has started to shoot up in place of smoking it so I feel like at this point his life is a ticking time bomb. 

He obviously has an addiction to heroin and I feel like there’s nothing I can do. I don’t want to be too nice because he doesn’t really have any friends left and he is definitely judged/disregarded by family because of it. 

However, at the same time, our mom continues to give him a place to crash. I guess this is considered enabling but she figures that he would be dead sooner than later if she were to just dump him on the streets. 

It’s extremely frustrating because he really wants to stop using but will start using every time life gets shitty. Like I seriously don’t get it he’ll go through the withdrawals and everything but whenever work pisses him off or something he’ll go right back! 

Rewind about a decade to sometime in high school, he was diagnosed as bipolar. Nonetheless, he refuses to take medication for it and at this point I feel like he’s just in complete denial of it. From my perspective he’s caught up in a loop of wanting to quit heroin but on top of the addiction, not knowing how to cope with stress/life. I seriously have no idea what to do at this point and like I said I feel like he is literally a ticking time bomb and any day I’m going to wake up to a call from my mom telling me he passed. Any and all suggestions are welcome, thanks for taking the time to read.

Thank you.,1.3274812343619686,3.4380816146789037,2.456196830692246,95.1020433694746,81.4770642201835,5.431526271893245,20.91826522101752,6.574015621080383,0.15978165137614694,412,12,92,4,11,131,80,109,0.087,0.795,0.119,0.5574,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,1,3,0,1,4,5,0,0,2,0,11,2,0,2,0,16,22,8,0,4,4,2,2,0,1,0,2,1,1,0,4,4,0,1,3,1,4,0,1,2,0,1,3,3,20,3,12,17,1,7,0,0,0,0,23,3,0,3,4,62,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3860481029138792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13614998570097894,0.14783963155716756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1829526962423534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17905604643649314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13679790019295046,0.0,0.09250774812463652,0.1698543002415439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1776079320321854,0.0,0.17437070721814485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15738111516447045,0.0,0.0,0.09730881407822434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1810582066048337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1181904657209744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13128945807760212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38872248746397065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17711022390427394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19902545318171727,0.0,0.0,0.3000486385165319,0.0,0.0,0.19820675786963807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20269398125060265,0.0,0.20092820920848176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1547602618167097,0.16301518443799184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2129841558127966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,throwita-way123,2018/03/31,"Stuck in between a rock and a hard place. Don’t know what I’m doing. Hey all, I need some advice because I don’t know where to turn. I’m addicted to booze. I don’t need it every night. I can go days even weeks without it. I can wake up one day and feel great about myself and life that day and end up drinking myself into oblivion that night for no apparent reason, other than the thought of getting drunk popped into my head. 

My past is riddled with friends leaving me because of how drunk I got and the mistakes I made whilst blacked out. Now I only drink alone (and fast) because I’m afraid of getting drunk around people I love. 

I’m at the point now that I just want it out of my life but I can’t kick it because of how much I enjoy getting drunk/enjoy the taste of beer/wine. I’m an entrepreneur, and I’m a mediocre entrepreneur because I drink. I could be such a better person and businessman if I just got alcohol out of my life. I don’t know how though. I’ve tried the meetings and I hate the meetings. I feel like the 12 step process just doesn’t click with me. 

Is there anyone who has been down my path and has found a way out? Thanks in advance for all your feedback...seriously, because I can’t talk about this with anyone, and I truly appreciate anyone who takes time out of their life to lend their advice, it means the world.

addiction,SheStay_High,2018/03/31,"Going to treatment for Meth addiction. Finally off opiates after 6 years. On Monday or Tuesday I will be going to treatment for speed. However, since last week I have used some pain killers and heroin off and on.
Even started trappin’. At first to prove a point and then to support my habit.

Just finished my masters and am a life coach /M.S. in Positive Psychology. That was in December 

Haven’t done anything since then except avoid a warrant for 2 months. Got off methadone. Go to Chicago for Xmas. Other than that I was in a very unhealthy relationship w someone who has a limitless supply.

addiction,MerLisk,2018/04/01,"I don't see a way to get clean TL;DR: I am a drug addict. I am doing everything people tell me I should be doing. It doesn't seem to be working.

I am addicted to Xanax. I have been sober for a little under 3 months now. I have been struggling to get clean for over a year now, ever since I ended up in the hospital and almost lost my life from Xanax withdrawal. 

Last year, I spent 9 months sober and 3 months high. I see that there are benefits to sobriety. I see the damage the drugs do to myself, my relationships, my family. 

I am enrolled in an out-patient rehab. I go to therapy once a week. I am prescribed medication for my severe depression. All that stuff isn't working. 

I feel like I function better on Xanax. I'm in college, I made Dean's List (3.75 GPA) while blacking out every day. I am more social. I'm able to do the things all my friends do (go out, make dumb mistakes, meet girls). The medication they're giving me comes with a ton of unpleasant side effects. I don't want to take it. But  I take it anyway. Keeps me from wanting to kill myself.

When I'm sober, all I do is hide from the world and play video games. I avoid lots of social situations because they're too difficult for me. I crave drugs every day.

It doesn't seem fair. I hate my life. I just want to escape. It feels like I'm wasting everyone's time trying to get clean.

addiction,sausagerolls_,2018/04/01,"Is weed addiction real? So I have anxiety issues and for a number of reasons, I did not want to take the pills that the doctors recommended. With my panic attacks becoming daily, I turned to cannabis as a solution to calm down. I don't know how it happened or if I'm even surprised but I have gone from not smoking weed at all to smoking every single day.

This wasn't a problem at first as I had the time and money to do so without it disrupting anything. However, now I'm running out of weed at what seems a faster pace and I feel irritable and anxious without it.

I’m like so suicidal over this shit but I would never do that because I have people who love me. If I didn’t, seriously I would just die I’m so over trying and then failing. I’ve worked steps, called my spons every day, gone to meetings every  day, I’ve been to treatment, lived in half way houses..etc. I do service work, I have even done service work in detoxes. I keep using after time goes by , start with just a Xanax and then be up for a couple days on meth or crack. It’s seems like I can’t stay clean like other people can. I had my best recovery I ever had the last 6 months, following the suggestions and just feeling better and better. Than all of a sudden I see one person , and I use. And now ive used three times since then. I’ve been trying for five years, and I’ve never had 9 months clean.

Its really fucking convenient though for answering mundane questions that pop up in my mind throughout the day. ,5.053387096774191,7.13441885483871,6.375032258064518,71.44254838709679,70.12903225806451,9.476129032258065,33.36774193548387,9.888512548439397,3.781828387096775,267,13,44,7,5,90,50,62,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.0,0,2,0,1,4,1,1,0,1,0,5,4,0,2,0,12,10,5,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,4,1,1,0,5,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,7,0,9,10,0,6,0,0,0,1,3,3,1,4,2,32,11,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6083107682033218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17993440484657444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2350727808937017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2579345678305165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15333322194328733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2817143581541892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2677117233276175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.312548170257724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17873701360105665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2539946306359961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17877440438809866,0.2741198706294202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

addiction,Anukari,2018/04/03,"Post surgery recovery dependancy Please forgive me if this isn't the right place to post this I am looking for help.

So the basic background: I had a pretty normal run of the mill surgery, a tonsillectomy and adnoidectomy. I am in my 20s so the surgery takes significantly longer to recover from and is much more painful but I needed it for medical reasons. I ended up with serious complications and hospital stay which loaded me up with several opioids and required I be on oral opioid pills at home for a month. I am just coming off my last dose about 40 hours ago and from how I feel and what I have been told and looked up I am having pretty typical signs of physical dependence. I am having muscle pain, shakes, irritability, insomnia, and I just can't fully explain how I feel. It's really awful.

Obviously the last thing I want to do is take more, I don't want my life to head that way. I have had very minor issues with alcohol and other substances before and I know how easily I become addicted to things or at the very least crave them.

My question is other than a desire to continue to take them, irritability, and anxiety/depression I have never had such physical symptoms before. What do I do? Do I just ride this out and feel shitty? Is there anything that has helped anyone minimize the discomfort? Pain? I am currently on immodium to try and minimize the less pleasant portion I'm dealing with but is there anything else I can do or am I powerless to suffer?",4.651203494014883,6.469319718861216,6.1465237787123925,73.74470317049501,70.67259786476869,9.664251051439665,30.210449692656105,10.018931242160765,3.305333096085409,1175,49,208,32,22,399,157,281,0.142,0.772,0.085,-0.9708,2,0,3,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,2,1,12,9,0,2,12,1,32,12,1,6,2,49,48,23,0,6,8,0,3,0,0,0,11,0,1,0,14,19,1,1,8,0,0,4,4,7,0,0,5,5,32,2,32,42,6,29,0,1,2,0,9,12,0,6,9,157,46,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1271881320666136,0.0,0.0,0.10342141230320068,0.1246853472933948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08157876856316174,0.0,0.19201986048012745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12885346763061753,0.19855610742937405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10050135707436124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12028222479388676,0.10048818272065993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09746328238184787,0.0,0.10333548686479706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17697642270168734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1197376544364538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1564036346636984,0.0,0.11703008482560576,0.0,0.1148970005075131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12177375310309542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0641190888016758,0.19020415709012956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08240786717479949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1959477730230276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1175333152459244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09312532821586664,0.0,0.08576628618686796,0.08650974221548413,0.08998352869881661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11431237769468115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.372437106481829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12189590356375865,0.12806923981662327,0.0,0.0,0.22347629229903107,0.23739180751776304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13069772896945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07474214851802509,0.11995676755417416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0996360211116142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13180452430672224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1243552938832776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12126538462399017,0.26316522479004045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15502147226911506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11148372027719804,0.0,0.07921165206054327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19253086213285286,0.1376306387176572,0.09260766028456503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,EightyHM,2018/04/03,"Cell phone addiction. I know this probably seems like a silly ""addiction,"" especially compared to what other posters here are dealing with, but the amount of time I spend on my phone is starting to disgust me, yet I can't stop. I work from home so I have access to my phone at all times. If I were just using it for calling/texting then I would be fine with that, but I'm constantly circling through a handful of apps (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Candy Crush). Once I'm done with one I go to the next and then by the time I've finished the last one it's been long enough that I can start the rotation over again. I've tried deleting apps but then I just go to the websites through my browser. I can't get rid of my phone all together because it's my main source of communication and I do use the smart portion of it for my work occasionally. I am starting to become disgusted with myself that I waste so much time on it, but that's still not enough to get me to stop using it. I'm not even looking or enjoying anything specific, I just am on it to be on it and am just aimlessly scrolling. I will tell myself to put it down and get some work done...and I do. But as soon as I finish my task I feel like I've earned time to be on it again. I don't feel the urge to use it if I'm busy, and I can go the entire day without it if I'm with other people or am occupied doing something else, but if I don't have other people with me and don't have a deadline to finish things then I spend almost all day every day from the time I drop my kids at school until I pick them up on my phone. How can I kick this habit and have it stop taking over my life?

addiction,yerdunclelarry,2018/04/03,"Ive been addicted to Marijuana for 16 years So here's my story.  I am 31 today, started smoking pot when I was 15 almost every day in high school.  I experimented with stimulants and opiates in my twenties but have no use for them now.  I don't drink alcohol as I get loud and stupid quick.  I have gone now 3 days without a hoot and I never thought marijuana withdrawal could be this bad.  The only other time I abstained from weed was when I was in the hospital last year.  They just pumped me full of morphine and valium I didn't feel the withdrawal.  I'm not looking at quitting persay but cutting back my daily consumption immensely.  I was smoking anywhere from 2-5 grams of very high grade marijuana (30% + THC).  The biggest issues right now are my guts are knotted, I have no appetite, and haven't slept since Saturday.  What can I do to relieve withdrawal.  I'm not going on benzos like my doctor suggested as they are pure evil.  Any help is appreciated",3.526370967741933,5.552802860215053,5.184610215053766,78.59691532258066,74.16129032258064,8.305913978494624,29.366935483870968,9.017664075816787,2.6770870967741938,756,33,140,17,16,256,128,186,0.142,0.782,0.076,-0.8903,0,0,2,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,3,1,10,6,3,0,5,0,21,6,2,2,2,21,32,12,0,1,6,0,1,1,0,0,3,1,0,0,3,6,2,1,2,1,0,2,9,4,0,0,9,3,23,2,17,21,1,29,0,0,1,0,5,10,0,1,18,91,26,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1969110548677484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.193036275186706,0.18087273384299268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1228331548836984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13889169304162782,0.15081673802539247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14421666727883542,0.0,0.0,0.2329800839790296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1848802927860552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17694656023450855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15218678240133485,0.0,0.0,0.17668872999413834,0.0,0.0,0.09133088523977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09437061407202817,0.0,0.10265498885589378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12107106294575044,0.3816865524941442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18852858194486807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14723583326639514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08824566009005835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15168192998047306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13931135923535898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13737564492853893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19211998819940426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15425522571270806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1828050615276449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14941725192162242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12784934574203904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14339836329662808,0.10532557153382996,0.0,0.1712141134467776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15600449675046082,0.0,0.14903692090281398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17411883412837315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2326368699200924

addiction,buford32,2018/04/04,"Government wants us Hooked on Meds I was hooked on So so many meds and substances and now im Free... i only take Kratom and i dont feen for it and take it when I Want To not when It Wants me to... I Have my life back ALL thanks to KRATOM

This Crack down on Kratom is getting out of hand. i noticed on FB when i post about this topic in particular it is hidden. It is not seen in all my feeds. They are literally hushing us up through the internet. Not everyone can go to rallies...

So...... Let's put signs in every one of our front yards that simply say... I AM Kratom.... 

That way people will see for themselves in person how many people actually use this herbal supplement and then they will ask as many questions as they want and I guarantee you your neighbors will support you. The Internet Is hushing Us Down and making us look like a bunch of Rejects... at 29 my life was turned around when I started taking opiates. I had no clue that  I was going to be in a  7-year battle that almost took my life. I was very successful prior too Pain pills . Those  7 years on meds I did nothing with my life. Now I have my life back and I'm kicking ass and taking names.

I really think this is the best thing we can do is put a sign in our front yard that states....

addiction,yeaboi12,2018/04/04,"Addicted/Obsessed with a youtuber, am I overeacting? So a few months ago I had some problems with anxiety and to help calm me down, I would play this youtuber in the background just because the person has a calming voice and his chanel is based around something I enjoy


But now that I am doing better I have formed this ""Connection"" to the youtuber. Connection as in whenever their videos are on I feel comforted and if his videos aren't on in the background I feel ""off"". That's not to say I watch him 24/7 but I listen to him when I go to sleep every night and have him on as background noise for at least 2 hours a day (ussually while I do homework).


The thing that made me come here, is whenever he streams I immediately drop what Im doing to put the stream on, I often try to talk to him in chat, and for a moment I considered going to a convention just to meet this person.



I know this is cringy but is it as bad as I think? Any tips on how I can roll back my ""dependence"" with this guy.

addiction,sh0nuff,2018/04/04,"YouTube Addiction? I know I watched enough YouTube to consider it a bit of an issue, and as someone with moderation issues (over 10 years sober from drugs and booze) I know I need to watch myself carefully. YouTube used to have a setting where you could track your stats, and it even had a ""total hours watched"" section.. It's long since been removed.

I recently looked up a Chrome extension called [timeStats](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timestats/ejifodhjoeeenihgfpjijjmpomaphmah?hl=en), which tracks your time spent on different sites. I went to install it to discover I must have already done so... over a year ago.

Looking into my behavior over the last 365 days, I was stunned to discover that I have spent almost 18 days, or 427 hours, watching YouTube.. that's almost 5% of my entire year.. and if you consider around 8h a day is lost to sleep, that number jumps to over 7%

Stuff like this is a real wakeup call. I've removed the shortcut from my menubar, and I have already caught myself mousing over the missing spot a couple times. I am optimistic to see how much time I can recover from altering this behavior",6.93265205091938,8.549705589108914,5.9846676096181035,77.85435643564355,64.89108910891089,9.137765205091938,34.23055162659123,9.424239791934726,3.2088927864214987,907,40,156,17,14,273,130,202,0.033,0.923,0.044,0.264,1,0,1,0,0,0,45.0,0,4,0,1,5,4,0,0,12,0,14,4,1,2,2,21,28,10,0,4,2,0,0,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,11,8,1,0,2,0,2,5,0,2,0,0,9,7,21,2,25,17,5,33,0,2,7,0,6,12,0,4,16,98,32,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14086148876089682,0.0,0.0,0.11453972843278708,0.0,0.2587767617464567,0.0,0.2851800156235089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11502716579788985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1410673766920309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26388230098751697,0.0,0.1317414953603389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10316624666236017,0.1429719767240542,0.0,0.2499955233821159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13500031937612614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13222999191452842,0.0,0.0,0.1498463194974888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13351180317167424,0.0,0.08534411703249938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2544979988726196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26973007426699297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1420244194146325,0.10532602492422344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06312705533634122,0.0,0.0,0.11434963877085155,0.2170131330567064,0.0,0.14105149977556586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09498658846131937,0.09580996971016333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14707293938825197,0.0,0.0,0.1275824721234674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10296621170672464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10688651567266054,0.0,0.12930654209265244,0.0,0.10948194694677084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14791822960053566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2260358132885757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1115987402557135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11978195489139913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2496272430689205
addiction,SergMajorShitFace,2018/04/05,"She came back last night She came back into my life again last night. She should have just stayed away. I had finally gotten over her, about to move out of town to get away from her. Now I’m back to laying around doing nothing because I’m not whole without her. I’m not happy till she replies. One message “Hey” and she rips away all the closure I worked so hard to get from her. The only thing I can do now until I pack my last box is go back to the pipe, cause that feeling is the feeling she gives me. She made it so much more than getting high. I’ll forever be chasing that feeling.

addiction,Smellycat19,2018/04/05,"Am I handling his gambling addiction the right way? My boyfriend of three years has a gambling addiction. It started about 1.5 years ago when he got his first job and made a couple thousand during the summer after finishing high school. He lost all the money within a couple of weeks when he discovered online gambling. 

The first time he lost his money he was living away from home and had also gambled away any grant money he received as well as the money his parents had given him for food etc. I felt bad and at this time I didn't know it would turn into a full time addiction I thought it was a one time thing. I was still in high school but working part time. I sold my large CD collection..didnt make a lot from it but nevertheless gave him what I could so he could buy food at least. He also gave me his password so I could log into the certain site and change his password so he couldn't have access.

The next time it happened was at Christmas when, again after working for a month and making some money he gambled it away..again I gave him what i could and he once again blocked his account for three months. 

It happened about three more times since. The biggest he lost was probably this October when he lost about 2000. That time it was more serious because we are now living together. His mom helps me out with rent but doesn't give him money anymore as she believes he still has his savings from working in the summer. 

Now once again he has gambled away his savings. This time not online but in betting shops. He knows he has a problem and broke down in front of me yesterday.

He asked me to help him in that he wants me to control all of his income. His plan is that I will keep his wages somewhere where he can't get them and only give him a certain allowance each week. 
Following this he asked me for petrol money..which I gave him. He also asked me to buy him cigarettes and pay for food for us for last night.

I don't make much money myself. I'm a student and working part time so I make about 200 a week.

Is this a good idea that I handle all his income? We won't be living together after May and he will be moving back with his parents and I'm worried he will again work all summer and lose all his savings.

How do I support him but at the same time not enable him as I think I'm doing by paying for his stuff?",3.920913642052568,5.0778307234042535,4.387984981226533,88.22411764705883,71.55319148936171,6.806007509386735,25.9511889862328,6.923569853693429,1.017762202753442,1840,57,375,15,34,581,203,470,0.068,0.8809999999999999,0.051,-0.7242,7,0,1,0,0,0,34.0,3,0,1,15,27,17,0,0,22,0,36,6,0,8,7,67,74,34,0,8,7,3,1,0,0,6,3,0,2,0,21,21,3,3,6,2,23,4,8,9,1,7,23,1,59,8,49,38,17,75,0,6,0,0,71,24,0,4,46,254,80,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21053405117787088,0.0,0.0,0.05706436220879986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15444147545423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04377706089007658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06384248809351148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18054520034036373,0.0,0.24192891608789815,0.049500235576999736,0.05375025602844423,0.039242271058511774,0.0,0.0,0.07252833743947652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0680999860919808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0722017945915134,0.20559210844359296,0.14245894899737035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07179490129970756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061809888327919574,0.0,0.0,0.1095143174311645,0.23352673443593136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033633167872116336,0.1235083181600718,0.0,0.053994514904705235,0.05148639582451655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11385281846876392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08629812202773292,0.13603098825622595,0.06457315754146069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07267129584972347,0.0,0.0,0.06388204031410036,0.05721926620779805,0.0,0.0,0.07075739590850269,0.05247404126521832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17053234204916878,0.0,0.0,0.07201891729939128,0.2810907266297764,0.05472913962362568,0.0,0.06091297750623311,0.1718826738327444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07539496944041794,0.10276667745638823,0.06842020802010401,0.04732287358368975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06846331351392343,0.060411374281776974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1371140888176406,0.0436220199346388,0.048959924366872326,0.0,0.0,0.14296115964420875,0.1394232364331276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06940690556057091,0.06159797465593311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05497571413053332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1303014372151727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05325148687741522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045564803725874785,0.0,0.10281957193903307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0736937265934113,0.0,0.07305174244915857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042767746285323316,0.041248762496734426,0.0,0.0511063880718326,0.4129119991221167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07002127973076758,0.0,0.0,0.07743493936206887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03796991572590334,0.05109770744857989,0.15491270702965032,0.0,0.05788066226669989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2343280486766076,0.06537571837363179,0.0,0.045729999827294435,0.0,0.0,0.0829105010728686
addiction,Ashley4645,2018/04/06,"Sister of addicts. Methadone &amp; heroin I just want to vent/ rant. So my sister and brother were always wild and sure to be wherever the party was. I knew since they were in middle school they were on the wrong paths.

 My brother wasn't secretive about it but my father being an addict himself was too far gone to do anything and actually encouraged his use to benefit himself. Or someone to share the high with. After losing my cool I begged my mom to send him back home. They were divorced at the time but she allowed him to move in with us in a neighboring state. 

Afterwards I started noticing my sisters dangerous behavior. Drinking, partying, and snorting coke at the age of 14. I begged my mom to do something. Once she confronted my sister about it a massive door slammed shut.  She was a really good liar and put on a front from that day on.  

My father passed away at 39 years old from crack related health problems. He suffered 3/4 Heart attacks within 2 years. His diabetes wasn't controlled because of his addiction. I got the phone call around 2am when I was 18 years old. Autopsy showed diabetic kiotacidosis and .10mg cocaine.  

He went into a coma while he was alone and never woke up. Alone. Because of his addiction. I hadn't seen him but one time in 3 years. And he had never met his grandchildren. He has 9. 5 granddaughters and 4 grandsons. They will never meet their grandfather. 

Now move foward 10 years. My sister is a daily methadone doser at the clinic and my brother just got out of the mental hospital for the 10th or so time. He goes there after he experiences something traumatic with his heroin use. They dope him up and he gets detoxed at the same time. His most recent was witnessing a guy get shot in the head while standing right beside of him. He is currently detoxed and hopefully he will continue to stay clean so he can be a father to his kids. 

My sister has 2 kids whom she does not have custody of. She lost them to my mother during her heroin battle. She says shes clean and goes to the clinic and she works every day. So if shes clean then why is she constantly broke, living with other people, and hasn't made a single effort to get her kids back? She in consumed with the clinic. She chases it. Shes there as soon as the doors open. She hustles up her $13 a day and ever so often visits with the Dr but she cant put that energy towards being a parent.

My main reason for this post, before getting carried away, was the methadone clinic. My sister was never on heroin before doing methadone. She was a recreational user of whatever she could get her hands on. Pills, coke, Xanax, alcohol, literally whatever. She had no real addiction other than partying. She wasnt hooked on any certain drug. She went to the clinic after someone told her about it...then BAM! LIKE MAGIC she gets a daily dose. Well she moves away and visited as a visitor several different clinics across 2 states. She got kicked out of the 1st one for taking pain pills after visiting the ER. So she became a regular at another one. Her car got wrecked one morning after dosing and she had no transportation to the clinic. So you all probably know by now that her heroin addiction started that day after. 

The use of methadone led her to a cheap, easy to obtain, and equally stong high! It was perscribed to her like it was nothing! Not a single damn given to her future. I get some people need it and if used in the manner its meant to be used for then ok. Whatever. But to steadily increase her dosage and continue allowing prolonged use was switching her from one demon to another! 

Within months heroin took my brother and sister. It took their children from them, it took their security, safety, health, and finances. Within months heroin robbed me of the people I used to know. 

Scared to death of that phone call.

addiction,vaselwhinequestbttom,2018/04/06,"Been addicted to cocaine since New Years Before NYE, I had a problem with alcohol. I started consuming much more than normal due to a move to a different state which had made me feel extremely lonely, even though I had made the move with my boyfriend whom I love very much. What I thought was going to be an awesome awakening move foreword, wasn’t. 

We came back to our home state, gratefully, but when I was trying to recover from alcohol at all costs, there was cocaine at this party and I felt that it would be okay because there’s no way I could get my hands on it afterwards since I didn’t have connects,

Mid January I was craving a high and I didn’t want to sneak around alcohol so I decided it would be better if I did coke. I asked my 21 yr old neighbor if she had a connect and surely she did. 

This is when I started my addiction.

My boyfriend told me at first (at that first party) it was ok in light of drinking as long as I didn’t do it all the time. I thought, fair enough, at least I’m not blacking out and I’m still having a mellow fun time while everyone else is drinking, and not embarrassing my bf.

Now, I’m using pretty much every day. Sometimes I’m open with him about it, sometimes I’m not. It’s only when larger events/parties happen when I share with him that I have it so that I don’t crave alcohol. I know he hates drugs, and I’m starting to as well.

I’m starting to get a deviated septum from the use, and I think I really need to seek help however I don’t want my boyfriend knowing/thinking I’m an addict for any and all substances.....which is prob the case anyways...

Today I bought a gram for my friends party tomorrow, already dipped into it and now I’m just regretful but still want to use....

If anyone have any guidance or advice to give that would be great. I’m thinking of going to an addiction meeting that happens in my town that I found out about, but my town is really small and I don’t want to blow my cover....

I realize I have to face my demons revolving my close relationships and become totally transparent, but I’m clueless on how to ease into it esp because my boyfriend has been betrayed by my drinking in the past...

TL;DR: Been using daily for 4 months, my nose is starting to show it and I don’t know how to ease into telling my boyfriend about my addiction and find the right help/Annon resources.",4.28960443037975,5.063694803797471,5.248056434599157,83.81929984177215,70.37130801687762,8.456645569620253,30.002373417721518,8.660442795831766,2.202536075949366,1843,72,376,30,32,605,224,474,0.048,0.7959999999999999,0.155,0.9936,3,2,10,0,0,0,58.0,2,0,0,3,24,15,1,1,17,2,42,18,3,8,5,76,91,34,0,15,12,0,3,0,3,3,10,0,2,0,23,27,8,0,12,4,2,6,12,5,1,2,27,6,56,10,53,56,10,63,1,2,1,1,20,24,0,4,30,249,79,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3988062457695557,0.0,0.07149652868550074,0.0,0.3127668875929955,0.0,0.0,0.08074000381492966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995101659235924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05115905375218269,0.0,0.0,0.06513285150810247,0.06839991263799985,0.0,0.0,0.05625979171937436,0.0,0.08920208037849987,0.08080560166296298,0.0622584941628458,0.0,0.0,0.06470898325028454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08368189768883708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05841673814961582,0.0,0.0,0.047185726922826375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07644242726906289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21502315378795614,0.0848488094891812,0.0,0.06112042863673092,0.0,0.0,0.07559957154676923,0.0,0.0483251557422088,0.0,0.06164513148943108,0.06991281847725682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03699470046488333,0.0,0.07025040190197238,0.0,0.06687198720529584,0.12446915892718675,0.0,0.08022224912687073,0.05652752244429957,0.0,0.07645196016914416,0.07018706248869351,0.08316333634519561,0.0,0.0,0.08066527718534401,0.0,0.0,0.12940010848539546,0.0,0.0,0.0722358331262734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0980826518189205,0.0773034206551527,0.07339101221637294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08041974568434877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06474920937505757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06603476545964845,0.1384620249807434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058400043979537734,0.2332902020205272,0.16135529338476964,0.054251328256601616,0.0,0.07066374412501751,0.0,0.0,0.07168670449461546,0.0,0.0,0.0767749369673607,0.0,0.0,0.0556456977501017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06984479634103022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07443566785226767,0.0,0.07000955013814793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09374344969737483,0.0,0.0,0.07855241927020487,0.0,0.062482979940499415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12104659808376465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1447251996003326,0.0,0.258934764397667,0.0,0.11686020550280055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06895766500761985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06394991561267076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14064459045684866,0.0718847814050308,0.11617054807661548,0.08532684118756265,0.0,0.06935238638819134,0.06991281847725682,0.0,0.04967460574532933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25276617491691783,0.0,0.06036924127619458,0.17261974820451914,0.05807540802352015,0.0,0.0,0.06578461629013033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15592412251908808,0.0,0.0,0.04711621538096196
addiction,polish-polar-bear,2018/04/07,"Can an addiction be passed on My father smoke cigarettes a lot up until he passed away when I was 12. My brother who is 10 years older than me smokes too. I am 18 and I had only had a couple puffs from a cigarette in my life, but I feel like I’m already addicted. I feel like I need to get some all the time. I ha e been successful at suppressing that feeling but I just don’t get it. Is it at all possible that it’s because they smoked and it has an effect on me? I don’t really know how that would work I just feel like I need answers ",-0.28679269882659497,1.6685466440677956,2.45,93.664295958279,86.79661016949154,6.342633637548892,19.246414602346803,7.61054688173877,0.5300344198174702,416,12,99,8,13,145,79,118,0.0,0.8240000000000001,0.17600000000000002,0.9628,0,0,5,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,1,3,5,5,0,0,6,1,13,3,0,2,2,22,23,7,0,3,4,2,4,3,0,1,3,0,0,0,8,2,0,1,7,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,4,4,17,5,11,17,4,14,0,0,0,0,5,7,0,2,8,68,25,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4109672792909754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20800514065254924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17709403990151673,0.0,0.0,0.11490271488071785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20856234307189905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3812280163491439,0.4039752574984848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19695813694283484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1035900403885173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13313717410073267,0.276262388067584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16024879692778274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2795282296609307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1433563368878475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2124959299438452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12075252983795398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10991095345585576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13722411185375627,0.0,0.0,0.13389900711445113,0.0,0.0,0.1213823946528053
addiction,BlackTims,2018/04/07,"If you are a former or current addict could you answer my survey for my dissertation on addiction treatment. Thank YOU! Hi guys,

Currently a student at the University of Lincoln UK. This dissertation thesis is very close to my heart as i've had family members who have succumb to addiction. The aim of the dissertation is to evaluate the most productive treatment methods.

I would very much appreciate if you could provide responses! And good luck in overcoming and beating whatever faces you. Thanks!  I'm also a listener and would welcome any PM's if you require support.

addiction,zoonautical,2018/04/07,"Anyone else? I was wondering if anyone else has been able to use anxiety medication (only when needed) after being clean for a while. 

Background: 
I've always been addict, started drinking every night when I was 13. Started smoking cigarettes and weed, too. Became a pot head, always was. Never had an issue with weed. Then got into pills, first it was adderall then Xanax and other prescription pills. I hated uppers, Xanax and other benzos, muscle relaxers, etc., were my DOC. Overdosed on expired pills, slept for 3 days, didn't eat, didn't leave the bed. Did quite a bit of acid, it was that other shit (nbome). Went a little (maybe a lot) crazy, and never did it again. Did coke three times, not a huge fan, I just don't like uppers. Got clean from everything but still smoked weed. I've been clean for one year from weed, and three years from everything else. 

Sorry, that was super long. Just thought I should post some background of my use. I don't hang out with my old using friends, haven't in almost two years. I've been having extreme panic attacks and I feel like I really do need an anxiety med for emergencies. I feel like I'm responsible enough to not abuse it but, I also don't want to kid myself, I'm an addict. Any advice? A while ago I was given non-narcotic anxiety meds and they didn't do anything to help me. Hopefully someone else has gone through this, if not, any advice is greatly appreciated.

addiction,powerfulmentalillnes,2018/04/07,"I just made a huge post about ibogaine treatment on r/opiates here is the copypasta, please share God damnit. I sat here for over an hour writing a post about my experience getting Ibogaine treatment at the best facility in rosarito beach/baja California/mexico.


If you have the funds or a generous and loving family member or friend that can help quickly contact me preferably via email hypernovaxx@gmail.com or via pm on here.


 Im so sad my long post got deleted.

Mods i hope i am not breaking any rules and if so please just delelte my post. I am simply a guy who has suffered from mental illness and self medicating with opiates or as professionals would call it 'substance abuse'.


Once i get the help i need i promise i will do all in my power to help others. And if i had the funds one day i promise i will personally pay for each and every one of your treatments.

Big pharma, dea, fda hate people like me. And they have natural plants such as ibogaine and kratom(attemptedly) banned for a reason. Once they get kratom banned they will do everything in their power to keep it banned. 

**Im willing to give my life for this cause. So if you need the help and are ready to be put i. Touch with the best Ibogaine clinic in existance please contact me quickly at hypernovaxx@gmail.com or via pm if i sadly dont get banned for this post.**

currently i do not have the funds for treatment myself but i need to fly out and get the treatment a week. Sadly i invested most of my funds withininto crypto in December when it was booming. Now sitting at a 60%+ loss. But i am going to do whatever it takes me to get the funds for treatment within the next week. From panhandling to dealing drugs (nothing deadly, maybe rcs or kratom).

**Quickly contact me hypernovaxx@gmail.com or via pm. And mods im sure some of you have have had Similar troubles in your lifetime so instead of deleting this post please maybe show some empathy and edit out the parts where and if i broke the rules.**

Some would call my behavior selfish, because I continued to use when I knew it would hurt my mother. I can't help but feel that my compulsion to use was more about me and my problems than it was about my mother, and that it's unfair for her to expect me to stop using simply because of her. But then that makes me think that I'm probably just an inconsiderate, self-centered brat.

addiction,SpagBolForLife,2018/04/08,"Tired of feeling like a loser Moved in with my GF 1 year ago and hoped my evil (once a week) Cocaine habit wouldn't follow and would stay back in bachelor pad land....it followed!!

Over the last year my addicted brain has been very successful in coming up with clever ways to find time to snort (she knows nothing). Usually it's retiring to the spare room to play games on a Friday night.

Then I fall into bed beside her at 4am/5am in sweats with heart palpitations.

What's wrong with me? Why can't i stop this madness? I know it's really wrong. It's ruining my wallet and my health and possibly (most likely) soon my relationship.

Thing is I find life or weekends quite boring unless I snort - otherwise I just sit around and watch TV bored!

addiction,CorporateRat,2018/04/09,"Am i addicted to coke? I have been doing coke every weekend for almost a year now. It is usually mixed with heavy drinking and sometimes MDMA.

I stay up to 7/8 am doing line after line. I feel absolutey HORRIBLE for the next few days (depressed and guilty) and promise myself ill NEVER do any drugs ever again. But when friday/saturday comes around and ive had a couple drinks my brain tricks me to believe its ok with 1 line. Just 1 last time and ill quit. And it goes on.

I dont know what to do. Yesterday i told eveything to my GF and she was very supportive and that felt really good to share my struggle. Im just so fucking scared i am going to do it again. I am too afraid to ask for professional help, i dont want to be stamped as a drug addict.

addiction,new_age_retro_hippy,2018/04/09,"meth addict, sex addict in recovery for ~2 years, ~one year sober tldr; meth and sex addict doing the thing and living free and happy now, get with me

new to reddit, wanting to reach out to a wider community. i don't meet a lot of people successfully recovering from meth addiction, and i meet very few people recovering from meth addiction AND sex addiction like myself. I'm sure there are people out there doing it, because I'm doing it, so lets get together c:

I've been sober for over a year now. I'm gay, and when i found meth in the bathhouse it was perfect for what i wanted - crazy, destructive sex on crazy, destructive drugs with friendly welcoming people (just kidding they were all crazy and destructive, like me). i was 19.. that was seven years ago. i was diagnosed with hiv four years ago, tried to kill myself later that year.. i really didn't expect to live to see another year, let alone four. life is totally different for me today, its absolutely surreal. i have friends (i had none), a job that pays rent and bills (and is legal), I'm going to school and have so much joy in my life.

one reason I want to reach out is that recovering for meth can be extremely demoralizing. i think its something chemical about that drug, but i felt like i had lingering effects for 6months or more. i felt like i would never stop having cravings... i would get the taste of shooting up and it would last for ten, twenty, sometimes thirty minutes. it just.. gets better over time. and the literature on people with a fusion of meth and sex does not have very optimistic statistics on the possibility of recovering... but stastics don't apply to the individual, and I'm living proof of that. 

i want to reach out to those of y'all suffering out there, give whatever support and hope i can because it can be done. early recovery might be total hell, but there is a life of joy, freedom and ease on the other side of that hell. we just have to stick together and take it one day at a time.

addiction,Savagegod23,2018/04/09,"Finally seeing a future after many years of suffering from addiction and homelessness. I am 25 days off of subutex today.  The longest I've been off of opiates/opiods in ten years.  I am using kratom for a short period but still consider this to be a huge step in the right direction.  I spent numerous years living on the sidewalk and shooting whatever I could get my hands on.  This past year I was living on the street in cali and became horribly hooked on i.v. meth.  I had sepsis  and almost died.  Almost had my hand amputated.  Got hit by a car. Had a seizure.  I've been attacked, shot at, nearly raped by homeless dudes and much more.  I've had three friends murdered in the past couple years.  My little cousin hung himself in jail because he couldn't handle the withdrawals.  I cant count the number of close friends ive lost to over doses. I kicked 100mg of methadone in jail.  This list of suffering goes on and on.  My father was a heroin addict as well.  Two of his best friends over dosed and died in our house when I was little.  Heroin has been around  since I was a toddler.  Anyways this past June someone bought me a plane ticket from Cali back to the east coast.  This saved my life without a doubt.  I was 110lbs and covered in sores.  I entered a program and kicked 80mgs of methadone.  The exhaustion from stopping crystal combined with the methadone withdrawal was really rough.  I made it 15 days and snapped.  I was afraid of relapse so I lied about using when I hadn't just so I could get back into rehab again.  They put me on subutex and I took 4mg for awhile.  After about a month I went down to 2mg and stayed on that side until I jumped out 25 days ago.  I am living way out in the boonies in northern New York with my grandfather.  We work outside during the day taking care of his land.  At night we talk metaphysics.  I have absorbed an amount of insight from him that can't be quantified.  He is encouraging me to write my experiences on the street and I hope I am able to get some of these stories on paper.  So despite my total lack of energy and minor withdrawals I feel I might be on this planet for a little longer than I ever thought I would.  \&lt;3",2.8953894193238483,5.030019042154572,3.630351288056208,88.5356344202246,76.37704918032787,6.440377109229567,24.53185612202006,7.419758726546812,1.1258832522668591,1709,58,338,22,39,541,234,427,0.128,0.7559999999999999,0.116,-0.8048,0,0,4,1,0,0,42.0,3,0,1,3,16,18,3,2,26,0,33,12,2,3,2,48,52,22,3,6,3,2,4,0,3,2,9,0,0,0,10,23,0,1,3,1,2,7,5,9,1,3,23,5,48,9,71,20,7,86,0,3,1,1,18,45,0,6,32,224,58,3,0.0964661760787622,0.0,0.0,0.21032474173646495,0.0,0.0,0.08551144465781876,0.0,0.19319388166523208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08587534872709197,0.0,0.10974420159893566,0.0,0.14835306980575913,0.0,0.05880488557093831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10123530030455136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09835369564591337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15404078414940645,0.1067379890151572,0.0,0.24885081249267715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20023332144940795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08725917905604788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09436243061294937,0.0,0.0,0.048776197109702164,0.0,0.0,0.10567398066484876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22358858503126666,0.0,0.15119878651969376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0771528133630794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09581267912603536,0.0,0.11130901539816784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0681369130081843,0.0,0.2900533530140529,0.25554420245946363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10530422659451684,0.0,0.0,0.09127862826028348,0.0,0.09780156157882604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10233536839616884,0.0,0.0,0.07699838140506461,0.0,0.0709137389583688,0.0,0.0,0.09316763397565957,0.0,0.09052697145193576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2762636413275664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09697515109577244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0617987025536662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08238158728903165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07687105281685351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07979781770630995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08173547794696166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10282010846681876,0.07703801282693906,0.0806500426712756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0725305590474889,0.07753585825830403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07658336843010573,0.0,0.0,0.09143865542875976,0.0,0.10717747107443934,0.0,0.0,0.0942334369453409,0.0,0.0,0.1666316068988872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0765703604404229,0.0,0.0,0.08673467741681957,0.08942511167827452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929899513364057,0.0,0.07022852509195092,0.0,0.0,0.0685268037365486,0.0,0.0,0.3106052731345217
addiction,throawaydeadbeat,2018/04/09,"I'm so scared. I am sitting here after doing a fuck ton of cocaine all weekend. I have been using coke more and more frequently over the past few years, and I know I need to stop. I'm an idiot; I have a heart condition too so just another reason why I should NOT be doing this.

Today I woke up and gummied what was left of the bag, and then my heart started POUNDING. for hours. I was so scared, I almost went to the ER. But it calmed down and I feel better, but still feel weird, tight chest, etc.

I am going to make my most sincere attempt to quit this time. I know it will lead me to an early grave. But how much damage have I done that is irreversible? Is my heart twice as old as I am as I've seen in some articles about coke use? Is my heart tissue scarred indefinitely?

addiction,slappedthrowaway,2018/04/10,"Took my first steps today. I have been abusing and stealing my (now ex...) boyfriend's adderall for months and he caught me again. The time before this last time, he said we would be done if he caught me again, and in my mind I didn't think he would follow through and I'd get away with it again. 

I was absolutely devastated yesterday when I came home and saw that he had taken the day off to pack up all my belongings (I'm not technically on the lease) so I could be moved back to my parents' house. I begged him not to do this, but he said there are consequences for my behavior and that he is not budging.

However, earlier yesterday I made an appointment with an addiction counselor, and instead of cancelling it and dwelling in misery, I decided to go, and I'm very glad I did. 

I was very honest with them about the adderall usage, as well as my alcohol usage and dependence. My alcohol usage has damaged other relationships in my life, and was starting to be an issue with my now ex. The counselors were very understanding, kind, and for the first time in a long time, I felt like I wasn't drowning. 

I start Naltrexone tomorrow, and I will be going to group therapy on Thursday night. 

I will get my life back and I will become a better person because of this.


tl;dr Adderall and alcohol addict finally taking steps to get help after realizing the damage it's caused in my relationships.",5.311384742951908,6.30182793283582,6.111442786069651,77.76531509121064,68.17910447761193,9.686898839137648,31.30679933665009,9.861636050157227,3.023153565505804,1098,44,207,25,18,361,146,268,0.08,0.8170000000000001,0.103,0.8126,2,0,3,0,0,0,33.0,1,0,1,3,13,10,0,1,12,0,25,7,0,3,1,39,48,21,1,4,5,3,1,1,0,5,7,2,1,1,9,21,3,0,5,0,0,10,5,4,1,2,20,4,33,6,31,18,1,48,0,2,1,0,20,10,0,2,29,145,42,0,0.0,0.13137352946814734,0.0,0.24174903650470586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35548791484703074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10417450652222214,0.17051827280023565,0.0,0.0675908326865147,0.12245718662523272,0.0943498950791181,0.0,0.0,0.09806349900419258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12681608145407128,0.0,0.11390331550715015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08852788987899668,0.0,0.0,0.0715078069950719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11346775269649212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10646126505051992,0.12146256687838344,0.0,0.18862730689645307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1737891636525398,0.0,0.12603022549943346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07431988223158321,0.0,0.11122071607214327,0.0,0.0,0.12793952344660947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1157289088451154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11546345600146515,0.0,0.09038121515073054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15663428785542333,0.05416989746162676,0.0,0.0,0.09812445985303432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10491642710796194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11195622075615423,0.0,0.08850259062920787,0.11784687042622867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1040524664169846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12311805052992625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09681529955550333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2380851839098177,0.0,0.0,0.2109427131875226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15696150818781285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0833672378347589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12679984365174954,0.0,0.0,0.0710468107282956,0.0,0.0,0.2586178359027347,0.0,0.10510036368848176,0.0,0.1231906914675866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11542898936769805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2744604566976844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09969357158814604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15753057525505118,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,fenwayswimmr,2018/04/10,"I am producing a film about addiction and the end of the world. Abnormal pairing, right? Our film is called *Mount Skylight,* and is a character study of four recovering addicts on a weekend hike. When they return to their hometown, they discover that everyone has disappeared. 

We are making a film that is not as much about the mystery as the internal conflicts. We want to paint a metaphor as to the feelings of isolation surrounding addiction, and how one must find it in him-or-herself to overcome their struggles.

addiction,hereforgiggles,2018/04/10,"The worst part of addiction Honestly. I wouldn’t mind most if it. But the one consequence that really eats at me is how much  I have to lie to those who I’m close with. I make up lies for why I’m up all night and why I’m a hungover mess the next day. I’ll say I’m having an anxiety attack and I couldn’t sleep. I’ll cancel plans and tell my boyfriend I need a personal day so he doesn’t see me sleeping til 6 smelling like an ashtray since he hates me smoking. I don’t want to lie anymore. I hate it. Even though my friends and boyfriend know I ski, they don’t know how much or how often. I’m terrified if they find out that they’ll hate me. I don’t want to be like this.

addiction,Cockwolf,2018/04/10,"How do I become social again &amp; find new friends? This all started about 6 years ago. I was then quite a motivated, social and reliable human being with a strong sense of direction. I had just started a night school for college and worked through the day.

After a while I met my then to be girlfriend and we hit it off quickly soon after we started living together. As we began to share a household I began to understand that my now-ex-girlfriend was in a way very reclusive and antisocial and had now retrospectivly judging a gaming addiction. I loved her though and wanted her to feel accepted. So I decided to invest myself in making her life as enjoyable as possible. 

Fast foward 4 years. I've completed my night-school and am now in college. But the juggling of the night-school, work and relationship has clearly affected my health and I have to realize that I've adapted my girlfriends way of living. I've gained a lot of weight, become a reclusive that has barely any social interaction outside of the relationship and somehow along the way I've picked up a gaming-addiction. Together with the working and night-school it was just too easy to live this way of live - coming back from work/school and to tired to do anything else than spending time with her and relaxing with some online-multiplayers together. 

The relationship ended soon after, mainly because we realized that if she wanted to get out if this life-style, she would need a professional help that I couldn't give her. She registered herself in a mental institution and since then we have lost contact.

Fast-forward two years. I've seeked psychotherapeutic help myself and overcome my addiction/depression. I am in college now, picked up sports, lost weight and gained a healthy level of fitness. I many ways I reconquered my place in the world. But after two years and psychatric help I still have a very hard time to establish human contact and create/maintain relationships of any kind.

I seems that I can't improve my social skills beyond a phantom-of-the-opera-recluse - level. I've never felt as fit and healthy as now for a long time and if you'd asked my a few years ago wouldn't have considered it possible - but here I am. 

But how can I find my way into the social realm again? In that way I still feel like Nebuchadnezzar in that William Blake painting.",6.977244410308927,7.788190854838714,6.883497183819762,74.34101297149684,64.4147465437788,9.931933777095068,33.81600955794504,9.906371001090498,3.359221129885647,1877,77,325,38,27,596,205,434,0.028,0.871,0.101,0.9714,1,0,0,0,0,0,52.0,5,1,0,11,23,11,0,0,26,0,24,7,0,7,3,72,47,40,0,9,9,0,6,1,3,2,4,0,0,2,14,33,2,0,12,3,2,1,4,2,0,2,11,6,45,9,53,29,5,70,0,2,0,1,41,20,0,7,43,221,59,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14243307931168253,0.0,0.0,0.11581764730527665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07078224138707732,0.0,0.08884978298148129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05375890732253994,0.0,0.061072327007322624,0.0,0.0,0.050232760024618135,0.0,0.03982299401054122,0.14429802432356545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05627379508807874,0.06849456577995414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04213078692015925,0.0,0.056266418363005694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054572683802762686,0.0,0.05786071136187591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0660630213458522,0.046669927908055873,0.06272457598095776,0.0,0.11941617211839604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05047180913669927,0.0,0.03413088505325691,0.06266802202919046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05852054423936901,0.0,0.0,0.06944000154994122,0.0,0.0,0.13136279465734216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06802846383190247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09228538929298337,0.03191568170451593,0.0,0.23074126455463645,0.05781271840721972,0.0,0.0,0.14262521027778632,0.055539043501942865,0.058960554691746936,0.0,0.04360656573845585,0.06623175886086538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06583468266060577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048439460404048576,0.050384540096834726,0.06309363743788311,0.0,0.24522146463997274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06825325845249794,0.0,0.0,0.14729371980815056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06948376142452728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2805488400124686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3305742260716601,0.0,0.05947163729645909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05403952385451321,0.0,0.0,0.3329654319269833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1387172701978537,0.0,0.10434113742778392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06418386672586139,0.0,0.1142788465627438,0.07508426890260947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1276308102169527,0.06800815686873135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10780394015753307,0.07706361970125727,0.3629771035040723,0.0,0.15910241697969785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19023658370916408,0.0,0.0,0.04640673080589695,0.0,0.0,0.21034361025593967

addiction,nothinbeatsagoodshit,2018/04/10,"Some advice please. I’m 40. I’ve been smoking since I was 17 and have been a heavy drinker since about 21. 
When I was in my 20’s to early 30’s I also smoked a lot of weed. I stopped at 31 when my wife got pregnant. She was always my partner in crime when it came to vices but it never got in the way of living a normal life. We have owned 3 houses and have had many well paid jobs. When she got pregnant we were living in a place not close to either of our families so I quit working to be a stay at home dad so she could build her business. It was a no brainer at the time as she made easily three times more than I did. 
3 years later I ended up working for her business because it was better to have our own schedule and always be there for the kid. 
It was great. We made serious money and had a nice house. 
I stopped everything for the first year of the kids life to do what you have to when you are looking after a young child but slowly the opportunity to drink and smoke cigarettes came back in. 
I’m not an alcoholic, or if I am I am a functioning one. Nothing comes between my obligations as a parent no matter how hungover I feel. 
But something had changed in the last year and a half. 
My partner insisted on moving back to her home country and since I had her living and working in mine for 12 years I couldn’t really say no even though I thought it was a bad idea. She wanted to open a branch of her business in the home country. For the first year it was. Good. We had work and a nice place to live. But after that the work dried up and the office in the other country started failing as she was not there. 
I had to fall back on my old skills which is hospitality. At first I loved it. It’s nice walking into a job that you have always been good at. Also the age difference is interesting as things that annoyed you when you were younger no longer matter and the confidence of age makes things easy. 
The downside is that the town I’m in is a wash with cocaine. The country I’m from does not have much so it’s like a Xmas and special occasion thing. Here it’s a quick text and grab some immediately thing. 
I may have always been a chain smoking alcoholic, but I’ve always been a functional chain smoking alcoholic. 
This coke though. It’s becoming a problem. My kid is almost 8 and I’ve gone from successful professional with a fully paid off car and beautiful house in the other country to the shit I was doing in my 20’s with rent I can’t afford in a depressing country with cheap drugs. 
I’m taking it secretly at work and home because I hate my life.

addiction,GoodTherapyOrg,2018/04/11,"Finding My Identity: How Therapy Only Made Sense in Sobriety (a story about recovering from alcohol addiction) Sharing this guy's story about working toward sobriety and his experiences with individual therapy along the way. Hope it will be encouraging for anyone who decides to read it. I know there are many ways to get help, and therapy is just one of them. I'm posting this story in case it could be useful/good to relate to for those going through something similar with alcohol addiction.

addiction,TwirilingTaurus,2018/04/11,"Trapped and don't see a way out. Ok this is my very first post on here ever so please excuse me but i really need to vent a little.
  So i have been with my SO for almost 20 years now and we have certainly had our ups and downs. Some good times but mostly our relationship has revolved around his addictions, whatever it happens to be at the time. It started with drinking, in our late teens and early 20s. Him spending all night at the bar and me chasing him all over town trying to get him to come home. He cheated and hit me occasionally and It became an issue fast. We lost the house we bought together because instead if paying bills he would spend all of his money and even some of mine on his then increasing cocaine habit and alcohol. He learned to cook the cocaine into crack and spent tons of money, stole my car all the time while i was sleeping to get drugs. He was arrested and had car impounded atleast 3 times. Every time I had to pay to get him out of trouble. He got 2 DWIs and I helped him pay for that. He lost his license and has not had one in 15 years due to habitually driving revoked. I have been his chauffeur for as long as i remember. I did buy him an $800 scooter before i moved out but that lasted 3 months before he was on his way to sell some meth one morning and got hit by a truck. He survived with a broken leg but the scooter was toast. He received a ticket in the mail for driving without a license, again.

   He eventually he started doing heroin. We decided that the best thing for him was to start methadone therapy,(which cost us 550 cash every month and he has been on it for 12 years, minus the times he was in jail) and for the next 10 years we spent living with family because we couldnt afford to live on our own with my income alone. He has stolen hundreds of dollars from me over the years. He has beat me up. Broken all my things. Thrown sour milk on me and put a fly trap in my hair. I have left several times but he always found a way to make me come back. He has many tactics to manipulate me but mostly he gets himself so fucked up that I'm afraid if I don't come back he is going to die in some way either self-inflected or by risky behavior. 
  I'm just tired. Tired of fighting. Tired of ignoring my needs to help him. I just want a normal partner that can live life in moderation. You work, you can have fun sometimes. But fun for me does not include hard drugs ie: crack, meth,cocaine, binge drinking to the point of black out or abuse of alcohol,heroin, abusing scripts or anything else that could could kill you, also including Any substance that someone would steal from their loved ones or suck a dick in order to obtain.  But i guess that is not the same for an addict. 
  
  The relapses are old. So are the excuses and lies. Everytime i have to give him my hard earned money i want to punch him in the face. I am tired of coming last. His needs before anything else. I just want myself back. 
  
 I was almost there, I left,  got an apartment, restraining order and changed my phone number after his last trip on meth and Xanax.       He was a complete shell of himself. Lost 60 lbs in 3 months, stop eating and sleeping. Was accusing me of cheating and all kinds of other crazy shit. I didnt feel safe so i left. I was very sad for him. He lost his job, his mom threw him out of her home, he had no money, and still had a habit. He came to my doorstep 5:30am on the coldest day of the year. I let him in. He again promised he would get clean and live like a normal fucking human, help me pay bills and finally have our family back again. Well...that lasted a couple of weeks and now he is back to lying, stealing and manipulating money out of me again. Just caught him doing meth last week and I'm livid. It should have been a deal breaker. He was told that was off limits. I dont even want it anywhere near me. But he wont leave.  He just threatens not to help me in anyway and blames me for his relapse because I'm boring and all i want to do is work, come home to a nice clean house and enjoy being with my kids. The party days for me are over. (I never have been much of a party girl besides a little weed and the occasional drink.)    

  And he knows i would struggle without him because he convinced me to buy this new car and insured that i really am stretched financially and kinda need the little bit of money he does give me. We have 2 children together and I just can't have their father arrested in front of them. Nor do i want to loose this place and everything I work so hard for. 

   How the hell do i get this man to treatment or to the place where he wants to be clean and live a normal life? Or how do i get the confidence to do it all on my own? How do I let go of feeling responsible for his well being? Why doesn't he care about my well being?

    He doesn't even apologize for his actions anymore. He just blames me for everything yells and asks for my money after he gives all of his to the dealer. He only takes care of himself. His money first goes to methadone and then I suppose whatever he wants to spend on other drugs and the kids and I are supposed to struggle. I'm tired of footing the bill for everything. Why do i even spend the gas money to take him to work if i see zero return from it. He most of the time doesn't even buy his own food, I pretty much provide everything.I don't know how much longer i can hide his actions from the kids. Because they are getting older and asking questions now. I would be devastated if they thought of thier dad as a bad person. That really screws kids up. So for now I pretend everything is fine and never discuss his sneaky, lying bullshit in front of them. Even though i feel like screaming.    ""WE  CAN'T AFFORD THAT TRIP TO SIX FLAGS THIS YEAR CAUSE YOUR DAD SPENDS ALL HIS EXTRA MONEY ON DOPE!!"" I would never do that though. 

So this morning, When i mentioned i was going to go to a meeting tonight, he laughed at me. Told me i was stupid. I have no one to talk to. My family and friends are so tired of hearing it, helping me when things go bad, just for me to allow him to worm his way back into my life.

addiction,TheJoystiicks,2018/04/13,"Can I be fixed? I've used drugs for many years, usually just weed then more often and by myself... I stopped countless times and sometimes for long, months probably. 

But then I was introduced to stronger drugs, speed and other cheap crap but I needed better and found cocaine. Buying coke is the worse decision I ever made in my entire life. I no longer enjoy anything that use to make me happy. 

Two weeks ago, I had to be taken to a hospital and barely made it out alive. My girlfriend left me that same day, I don't blame her... i hate myself! 

I know I don't have long before it's too late. I burn every paychecks on drugs and I can't stop it. I tried going to professionals but it doesn't improve my condition so far. I've tried deleting/blocking my pusher but he will find me no matter what I do and I can't resist! He knows where I work, where I live. Also my social/work circle is full of drug users and can't avoid it.

I can't go to a locked facility. I have to work to pay bills and my job cannot afford to lose me for weeks !!

Anways... Is there any hope for me or is it too late? Am I stuck in this shithole for the rest of my life?? I'm only 23 how did it come to this....

I am trying to understand their addictions from their point of view but I'm continuing to struggle. I want to be supportive of them but when is it too much? Is it wrong for me to not want them in my life? Would I only be hurting them more by trying to make a separate life for myself? (I am 19, my mom has been an alcoholic for 15 years and my sister has been an addict for 6 years)",2.584411764705884,3.899243470588239,4.884460784313728,82.75257352941178,75.07843137254902,8.237254901960785,23.534313725490197,8.841846274778883,1.6405254901960782,382,11,79,8,8,134,59,102,0.125,0.821,0.054000000000000006,-0.8621,0,0,2,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,5,0,2,4,0,1,6,0,13,8,0,1,0,11,20,5,0,3,3,4,0,0,0,1,8,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,1,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,2,2,16,1,16,15,3,6,0,1,2,0,9,2,0,1,4,63,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6341919002345475,0.0,0.1421195125083123,0.0,0.3108561940747272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13710521374973828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1556934910505223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2054531387035794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12213058767849228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09708043567554094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3406684952151586,0.0,0.0,0.10691304905795447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11061151615089714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13748512852997874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1520425006159115,0.0,0.0,0.1650403691234802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1974845739329021,0.0,0.0,0.15140521585456004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1715652138305074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10331438783634776,0.15901270668942674,0.0,0.18731352932207224
addiction,timeclockcalendar,2018/04/14,"Welcome to the casino. Thank you for your life. Welcome young man. Good morning young ladie. Come on in, ill open the door. Have some fun! Its glamor! Its flash! Its an escape. Your gonna absolutely love this place.

......#=\'÷\;!=&amp;!/**.:#÷\,8=÷:,#÷7\,...... Ok hes in....... Shes in........ Hahaha..... My name is casino and im in many ways a demonic poison. Dont tell anyone this but I have somethings to share with you.

× I program the machines to display ""near wins"" you were never close to a win you fool.

Why?

Because I want you to feel a rush. 7-7 and as the last slot reel spins, your heartbeat rises. Will it be another 7? Probaly not. But maybe. Doesn't matter. You see its that moment when your brain is releasing dopamine that matters. Just like cocaine. More so like crack cocaine. I want you to become addicted to me. Electronic crack. Bet more for a bigger rush. Please do. Just keep playing. Keep coming back. Ill even pay you out from time to time. Just keep coming back.

These slot machines are designed to get you addicted.

3:00 am monday morning. Grandmas eyes looked glazed over. Shes in her stool in a trance ""playing pennies"" smoking her cheap cigarettes. Coughing as she puffs. She licks her lips and grits her cavity filled mouth. Only a few more dollars left. She just got her welfare check yesterday. Not much food at home but then again she only has one mouth to feed. Her own. You see this sad old women's love of her life. The man who gave her love and attention does not exist. She never met him ten years ago as it should have happened. You see that chance encounter at the mall was saccrificed for a binge on the choo choo nickle slot. All abord... Next stop... Hell.

Funny thing is.... This is real.

An old chinese proverb: To get revenge on a man is to teach him to gamble.

We like to get em young. Young white males are are favorite targets. We know that problem gambling leads to more suicides then any other addiction known.........

Casinos dont care.
Sheep to the slotter... Slotter get it haha

The more you come the more your brain changes. You dont even know it do you. There is a physical change going on in there.. Its not just a ""habbit"" its much more than that. The more you gamble the weaker your neurochemisty gets. Soon you wont even want to be around anyone. You wont want to do anything... But play..

Its about the money but then again it isn't.

Gambling is a drug... Its worse then anything on the street.

No clocks... No windows.... We don't want to disrupt your trance. We don't care if you have worried family at home.

We just want your money. Even at the cost of you losing your house, your car, your family, your friends, your life. Its a cold world. Sorry bud. Have a complimenty sprite.

Crime increases significantly within the proximity whereever a casino is built. This happens everywhere.

More than 80% of the profits generated by these fucking places come from pathological gamblers that need help, not another 10.00 free play coupon in the mail.

Its all bad people.

Ricky is a lonly guy. He works hard in the construction sector. He sweats and bleeds 50 hours a week every week in 90° weather. Gets paid and blows it all on the cards. Well at least he has enough money for gas to get to work tomorrow. Have to pawn some shit off to pay rent............... Ricky has many names and faces.

Fuck gambling. Seriously FUCK the casino. Ban yourself if you have to.

Don did that.... Yeah donny boy cooked up enough courage and walked on over to the desk after donating another few hundred dollars.

Id like to self ban my self from this place please. You see i have a problem.

They may smirk. They may think your joking. They may have you wait while they gather other employees to discuss the actual procedure..........

Sir youll have to come back latter to talk to our manigment there not in right now.

Ohh.... Ok....

Yes sir im sorry they are attending other matters right now.....

Oh... Ok.... Well as long as im up here can you check my card. I might as well see if i attained enough points to spin the wheel.

Sure sir..... Well sir not quite enough but the good news is it looks like your only short by 2 points....

Addiction............

Sorry for the poor grammer and randomness of all this. I guess im just venting. I lost over 10 years to this addiction. I finally broke it tho. My advice is simple but its not easy

You just have to see it for what it is. God bless you all. Love yourself and stay STRONG.",0.5582193635748139,2.977956900473938,1.3713324306025747,95.96836966824644,98.478672985782,4.2597698036560585,17.876912660798915,6.1442798453823615,-0.10949916046039254,3400,100,690,39,140,1045,396,844,0.132,0.7120000000000001,0.156,0.9325,3,0,5,0,0,1,276.0,6,41,5,10,33,56,6,0,45,6,59,34,9,1,8,100,115,34,1,13,26,0,2,5,2,10,15,0,5,13,44,26,3,7,6,12,29,16,21,15,4,2,8,14,85,42,92,95,27,106,3,4,10,7,106,47,5,12,46,417,129,10,0.0,0.0,0.05046992032127929,0.2819046917949076,0.0,0.0505388446076099,0.04584544310322633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05603711171366958,0.0,0.03517044047419469,0.1626944723264554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07232573428081013,0.0,0.08512004808561968,0.04604054381015109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11930529734677475,0.043182894001676665,0.03152719552829685,0.05711916118099725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11547018621033887,0.0,0.0,0.10546117600445597,0.0,0.10942290132978852,0.2673061106944718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045259319794377764,0.0,0.1818415401291764,0.0,0.05997718877761474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2137566714943958,0.0,0.1366386638119021,0.0,0.043575174605530814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0975114390740102,0.0,0.026150492233323986,0.0,0.0,0.056655228869634,0.0,0.0,0.06253837013891278,0.0,0.039957683616113716,0.14343911431114606,0.18914593926315934,0.0,0.029392888087534437,0.08675826260503583,0.04136411131217488,0.0,0.056973899433213876,0.05120957280463291,0.0914692236838276,0.0,0.046329732017852836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03466590609443105,0.0,0.10375600131061087,0.0,0.050932430549834415,0.05967635271200219,0.0,0.0,0.22345997233986095,0.0,0.0,0.13790967839469365,0.0,0.0,0.05684641066145971,0.04215758452566979,0.0,0.0,0.05619244053182435,0.0,0.10959118914595156,0.1263355458972791,0.0,0.0,0.04576935819452245,0.08686124352077816,0.057859915498995024,0.05645699178848749,0.0,0.1867123236119818,0.0,0.0,0.10486914224665207,0.05195831317404242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054865291166909164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07603828464511105,0.0383487072579071,0.07977718836588464,0.0,0.05500334749867582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1085399999269996,0.0,0.035045880748543416,0.11800304112854378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03585518459808061,0.0,0.162104875196402,0.11354304522690688,0.09778164059249042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09897548427964638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05500912693537655,0.0,0.058867121190225226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08833485126876381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24727830238180376,0.0,0.10790761661093358,0.0,0.05308842831496036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039815526495165066,0.0,0.17368430897754647,0.0,0.05512517595096073,0.0,0.04323908872495776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05657178464137396,0.0,0.04874419472382683,0.0,0.0,0.04156947403315653,0.045204360368812736,0.04761556394658293,0.0,0.0,0.03435955827917148,0.03313920844682487,0.0,0.0,0.060315095668567215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1830299202865105,0.04105183951706242,0.08297112735158083,0.0,0.18600503053135636,0.0,0.04666801735497541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07530355414319734,0.05252277710673671,0.05270570026841296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06661020140184835

He doesn’t really talk about how treatment is going, when asked,  and I didn’t know he was doing the 12 steps.  I feel a little in the dark, I guess.  I assume everyone wants rehab to take the first time and wants life to get back to normal.  My question is how can I give him unconditional support but let him know I am not accepting another slip-up?

addiction,BobbyBigBalls24,2018/04/16,"I was able to turn my life around So to get started let me lay out how fucked up my routine used to be. 

Morning: pop an adderall, chug a coffee/monster, and throw in a dip.

Mid-Morning: smoke some pot

Afternoon: take another adderall, drink more caffeine, and either dip or vape.

Evening: watch porn

Night: get drunk and smoke more pot.

This was my life towards the end of college- a dopamine seeking hellhole. The only other thing I did was play video games and quickly fell into a period of depression and anxiety.

It's been a year since I graduated and I am not a slave to any of the addictions I used to have. The first thing I cut out was niccotine (because my gums were receeding from dipping), then adderall (very depressing time quitting), then marijuana, then porn (only once in the last 150 days), and I have about two beers one night of the week. I am currently only a week in with no caffiene 

It really has been a shitty ass withdrawl period because there were so many things... but I had to quit them at some point or I'd grow up to be ashamed of myself. 

In the mean time I've been working hard at my new job and am in the best shape of my life. I'm just so happy with the changes I've made I wanted to share my success with other people.

addiction,billsweg,2018/04/16,"Tobacco or Weed addiction? I have been smoking weed since about 16 years old. I’m 22, underweight, dropped out of university, anxiety riddled. I want to be able to control this habit, not abuse it like I have been doing the past couple of years. Don’t get me wrong - I love smoking weed and don’t want to cut it out entirely, forever. But it’s getting to the point where I need some self control. I haven’t gone without smoking weed at least once a day for the past four years. Most of the time I’ll need it to eat and sleep, as well as function properly throughout the day. If I’m busy throughout the day, working or have to be out and about I generally won’t smoke until later that night. Although this will mean I won’t eat much that day until then, nor will I think properly. Here in the UK most of us smoke weed with tobacco in our joints. I never really liked smoking cigarettes or putting tobacco in the Js, I was pretty healthy at the start, very sporty too. 

Anyway, the point I’m trying to get at here is this - am I feeling the addicted cravings to the tobacco in the joints or the weed? Can anybody help me cut it out? Even if it’s just for a week, I haven’t been able to convince myself to put it down for years, not even for one day.

addiction,Squekk,2018/04/17,"I think I might be addicted to my phone. Help! I'm in middle school, writing this from the school library computer, and I think I might be addicted to my phone. I find myself playing on it until late at night, taking away sleep that I need. Recently my dad found me playing games on my phone late at night and he took it away from me. So I've already gotten rid of it. 
Is there a way for me to turn my life around? He wants me to 'find something else to do' so that I don't use it as much.

addiction,ItsElmoHere,2018/04/17,"My Enema Addiction Story 
I want to thank Millie, My best friend, ever, who still sticks up for me today. She saved my life a few years ago. I used to have an addiction to enemas. I didn't have an enema kit, so I would use a shower head, I would unscrew the shower head, and put it up- You know. Yeah, that. 


I just loved the full feeling that it gave me, and I love how it felt to release all of the water, And after a while, It got painful. But I still loved it, I just enjoyed it so much, and I ended up telling Millie about it. And she said that I should see therapy or something, and that's a real problem, But no, I didn't go to see therapy, I just kept doing it. And after a while. I listened to Millie and tried to stop doing it, I stopped for about a month, But it was so hard to not go back to, I just felt this need to keep doing it. So I did it again after a month, and it hurt SOOOOOOOO much, it was screaming so loud, It felt like I was going to die. I was super close to popping my colon, it could've killed me.

 I told Millie, and she said, ""You should've listened to me. I care about you and I want to keep you safe"" But even after all of that. I still really wanted to keep doing it. I wanted to do another one, I told Millie and she talked me out of it, and had a HUGE two hour conversation with me about why I shouldn't do it. And I finally stopped. She saved my life. If I never met Millie, I wouldn't be here right now. And I'm so glad she saved my life. And thank you so much Millie, thank you for everything you did to save my life.",0.7203792415169659,2.244364790419162,2.7777485029940117,94.97718163672657,80.7365269461078,5.890459081836327,18.01956087824352,6.742157984588678,-0.20563241516966047,1176,23,284,12,30,397,140,334,0.085,0.723,0.191,0.9886,2,0,1,0,0,0,53.0,0,7,0,2,25,23,1,0,13,1,23,17,3,3,4,66,61,32,2,12,11,0,5,1,1,5,10,6,2,0,26,19,1,8,5,0,0,4,7,5,0,2,20,13,55,18,36,35,8,37,0,1,2,3,29,8,0,2,26,211,81,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19542305511473296,0.0,0.0,0.07945288616231358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0939864067470197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06892106439245489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09406269327914688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09138525275848056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07156343186781393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930233102638098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07938687445425532,0.0,0.0,0.059200737665319275,0.08107679209373746,0.0,0.0,0.0805549817715597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04532036210937041,0.0,0.2581807890739655,0.09818688936528283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06924904794817885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15281888230039695,0.0,0.0716864709954175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0802921877242344,0.0,0.1839754846779941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08826893868893919,0.0,0.09595233767986856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2390056947100105,0.0991639366313811,0.0,0.04925910940430234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2532374193584965,0.04378940661050723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24268769133130905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1430859613456343,0.0,0.1976683209370194,0.06646059599367156,0.06912931184144244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060736600741374026,0.0,0.09537419883988707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08576520754335545,0.0,0.09010437926078313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10202023062791447,0.057420211980083326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07654478184690154,0.17052009828586887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14284934684649148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0690026811822941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21473941252435536,0.2248077559087532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07204237683442094,0.07834185156279408,0.2475618333506288,0.20500278464615945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0849601490150007,0.1712934128218494,0.0,0.06085388154867,0.0,0.08755691788698063,0.0,0.0,0.15482561599747371,0.0,0.0,0.21146784262473475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08087845638173785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12734324295734764,0.0,0.0,0.057719725135096274
addiction,ericmst18,2018/04/17,"Babysitting my mind 24/7 .... I'm struggling with a addiction to Kratom, I've been using it since 2013 and the past year and a half I've tried to stop, but failed.   My last time I had clean time was in August, i had one month before being temped to try it again which at the time I thought wouldn't hurt, but here I am months and months later I landed myself in a pickle.


For those who are new, or have been there— how did you get through the rough patches of going forward after addiction?


I hate how I have to babysit my mind 24/7 and watch myself, my thoughts, ideas, actions and everything else, i miss being normal where's I could just enjoy each and every days without having the cravings to get high.


How have you overcome the mental challenge ?


Thanks,

I had an oh shit moment and went over. By the time I got there, she was in the truck and was driving away. I followed her and we ended up at a windmill. I tried to talk with her and pleaded with her to come with me back home. But she refused. I said she should not be driving and is not only endangering her life, but the lives of everyone else. She said she didn't care. I said I will call the cops if she won't come home. She told me to fuck off. She started her truck and sped off. I got on my phone and called 911. I followed her anxiously waiting for the police to come. Unfortunately, the cops didn't come in time. She swerved into oncoming traffic. Thank goodness the other drivers were able to maneuver out of the way. She over corrected, then the truck went off the road rolling three times. After seeing this happen, we all rushed to check on her. Well...she was not injured. But the truck was totaled. When she saw me, all she did was blame me. That it was my fault that she wrecked her boyfriend's truck. My concern immediately went to disgust. All she could say was the most hurtful things about myself, my mother, and my sister and her kids. I didn't want to listen anymore. I walked away and sat down. I got on my phone and told my family what had happened. The only person that was genuinely concerned was my mother. Her brother, her mother, my dad...it was all met with, ""Oh. Ok."" It has come to a point where actions like this from her are expected. I sat there shaken and upset. Then I had a thought. A thought that I now find myself pondering why I even said it. ""Everyone would be better off if she would just die."" 


I don't know what else my family can do. It's been over two decades of the same thing. My cousin is 44 years old and can't be a responsible functioning adult. She lies, will cheat you, steal from you just to get money for booze. Meetings, religion, hypnosis, rehab...nothing works. She was just released a week ago after spending a few months in another rehab facility. Our family was hopeful and optimistic that she would finally get the help she needs. She was released a week ago. We were happy to have her back. It seemed like we finally had our family member return to us. Fast forward to today, and she was drunk driving.. She could have killed someone. I understand she is family...but I am at my limit. I feel my parents are done too. I can't even imagine what her immediate family is going through. I am upset with myself for even thinking how much better it would be if she would just die. I feel like I need to talk to a professional or something. How dare I. I just don't know what else our family can do.",1.5433362068965517,3.957050656896552,2.735064655172416,91.59483836206896,82.94827586206897,5.900862068965517,21.64870689655172,7.231253607405505,0.6956120689655179,2271,73,475,33,64,727,247,580,0.123,0.805,0.071,-0.9844,3,0,1,0,0,0,97.0,8,3,0,4,25,21,5,2,27,1,65,7,1,2,6,91,118,30,3,17,18,10,2,3,0,9,3,6,4,3,22,34,2,3,12,2,3,19,11,10,0,2,49,10,104,11,59,54,11,78,0,1,2,1,85,30,2,7,33,342,126,2,0.06483862957141401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11495106595202614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0679889564898848,0.0,0.0732491958335429,0.06430249787534623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05772012690630291,0.0,0.0,0.1218360536790229,0.09971380778133117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11468899760114512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19862247055737836,0.0,0.06610730411619317,0.0,0.0,0.27926369085576425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10353673949093542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13458452159140066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0663524295429176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1624930652870714,0.0,0.05742778067541629,0.1339912736109463,0.0,0.1284759099727188,0.0,0.0,0.12391217830782633,0.0,0.0,0.3667445368180343,0.0,0.06556871858828704,0.046320729921188936,0.0,0.14205509881661754,0.05926133277745683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0599422682430147,0.06775101567063536,0.062199121644843626,0.07369857478447883,0.05438356623655819,0.2592868759489723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11467317199427778,0.069021926848188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04345996666206566,0.0,0.19511529623652826,0.06439938911878834,0.0,0.0,0.06941109398063229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07173433697858071,0.0,0.07126723027159003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04579744157237263,0.09503063784872456,0.0,0.057253697810319575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05175357552729375,0.0,0.04766385316332551,0.09615404451982268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06352809043542497,0.062214413781281536,0.0,0.06803723470372239,0.0,0.0,0.09862539905921637,0.0,0.0,0.07199562500457322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056614590399229725,0.0,0.0,0.1225869252843329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2467055384767425,0.05156228066722125,0.0,0.0,0.051667993082747284,0.059026653193194174,0.0,0.0,0.06655592149891291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05493756042655328,0.049915944772908886,0.0,0.0,0.045893115733241764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10422966881173268,0.056671820123698036,0.05969469876474358,0.0,0.0,0.08615180882728936,0.04154597576024765,0.0,0.10294925866899696,0.15123170528615335,0.0,0.06145943945173943,0.12391217830782633,0.0,0.04402117335956483,0.0,0.0633379196699113,0.06749930004092827,0.07799288800451774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038243503632185635,0.05146588616400289,0.104019275272686,0.0,0.0582977147910745,0.1803181776094002,0.05850677818451006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04720329455234056,0.0,0.0,0.23029751068184334,0.0,0.0,0.041753951626016486
addiction,gracedwithQuestions,2018/04/17,"How do you know? I've smoked off and on since 15 but have increased significantly in the last year. I had a terrible reaction to sativa about six months ago,  but smoked again 2 days later. I keep smoking because it helps my chronic pain, but I feel like I smoke now for emotional/psychological support (i.e., it allows me to shut down).

I don't think smoking is bad, I was prescribed it,  after all.  Nonetheless, I'm starting to wonder, how do you know when you have a problem?  Does it mean I should stop completely, even though it does relieve my severe chronic pain and migraines. Or, could I follow some sort of medicinal level-schedule?  Any insight is appreciated.",4.787500000000001,6.802491782258066,5.4234193548387095,78.26512903225809,70.69354838709677,7.863225806451613,30.94838709677419,8.548686976883017,2.5559412903225813,527,23,93,9,10,170,91,124,0.196,0.6609999999999999,0.14300000000000002,-0.8604,0,0,3,0,0,0,24.0,0,3,0,0,8,8,0,0,3,0,11,5,0,3,1,24,22,10,0,3,4,0,1,1,0,1,5,0,0,0,5,2,0,2,7,0,0,2,1,5,0,1,2,1,14,3,11,18,3,19,0,0,0,0,4,5,0,4,13,60,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17133031043637706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13143645424170494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16138002239807694,0.1178211798474542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20264951829581387,0.0,0.0,0.1543176791936447,0.0,0.0,0.12464906635399893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33827978466912473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1276590600062139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09772774891304656,0.13807866801946775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12955094444924653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1717953949341076,0.0,0.0,0.2124423394467368,0.1575483091693034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09442643295645993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21053766315003813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1542735787240855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.411325299410188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1849420498460533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2183504321154088,0.0,0.15988251554486427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13680398176995415,0.0,0.0,0.1615900292980639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21933089632959252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.123845479212104,0.18989578992506226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20960300048267225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12446543987711114

addiction,domin262,2018/04/18,"Should I discontinue treatment? Background: I’ve been in treatment for almost three months now (IDD DBT: inter-dual diagnosis dialectical behavioral therapy). This was for my depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse. I’m 22 and in school still so my alcoholism was due mainly to environment and lack of coping skills. Somewhat genetic too I suppose.

Experience: through treatment I feel I’ve had a huge wake up call and gained several skills that I can use for the rest of my life. I now know ways to recognize early warning signs and how to cope with those. I’ve gained support systems and have also started individual therapy with a new therapist as well as family therapy. I’ve made a lot of progress but feel I’ve gone about as far as I can.

Problem: this much therapy is driving me crazy. I seem to feel always irritated that I have to attend so much therapy when I’ve been having very few urges to drink or act on impulses. I’m aware it could just be over confidence but I feel like I have a good handle on my mental health at this point. I also know I don’t want to remain completely sober for the rest of my life. I don’t plan on ever going back to how things were, but I’d like to be able to enjoy a glass or two of champagne at times. Now that I have goals, values, and coping skills, alcohol doesn’t appeal to me as it did before thankfully,

Questions: can/should I stop treatment? I would still be seeing my individual therapist and family therapist. Is what I’m experiencing how everyone in treatment feels after a certain point? How do you know you’re ready to support yourself without treatment?

She's been through several types of addiction and in and out of rehab her entire life, to no avail. She lived with my grandma until she passed a few months ago and now is basically homeless, bouncing around to whoever will take her in. Problem is, as soon as someone is nice enough to let her stay, sure enough she gets fucked up on pills and they kick her out. She's staying with me tonight and promised she would stay straight (which I knew better) and is already high as a kite.

addiction,drylthroaway,2018/04/18,"Benadryl is ruining my life (LOOONG post ahead) I honestly don't know how many people will be able to relate to this problem. From everything I've read, people hate taking DPH as a recreational drug. I agree with their reasons, but it doesn't stop me.

For anyone that doesn't know, DPH is the main (and only) ingredient in Benadryl. Each pill is 25mg and the recommended dose is 1-2 pills every 4-6 hours and it's recommended to not exceed 6 in a day. On my worst nights, I've taken anywhere between 80 and 120 pills. My average amount, which is to say the normal amount I take daily, is around 24-30. Usually it's like 8-12 pills at a time. The problem is that the tolerance builds quick with DPH and because of this I'm stuck in cycles. This isn't exact, but it's a usual timeline of how I take it:

* Week 1: 12-16 a day, usually taken all at once
* Week 2-3: 24-30 a day, usually spaced out in 2 doses
* Week 5-6: Varies greatly, 30-45 depending on how many I have
* Week 7-8: Varies the most, usually alternating between 40 a day and 50-60 a day with the occasional ""fuck it"" day that consists of 70-80.
* Week 9: Depending on my physical state and supply, this is usually when I stop. Almost the entire week is spend in extreme nausea and stomach pain. The first few days off DPH I'm pretty much couch ridden because when I stand up I feel like puking.

Then it pretty much repeats like that. 

The first few weeks are the type of high that I try to attain. On these doses, I'm out of it. The thing is, it helps my creativity immensely. I write a lot, I make a lot of music, and when I'm on DPH I have the motivation to do things. When I'm not, I have absolutely no motivation to do anything. At all. I'm sure this is the main cause of my addiction. I've been depressed since I was 15 and I'm almost 26 now. I thought it was a phase, but when I checked myself into a psyche ward after I feared for my safety, I was diagnosed with MDD (although I most likely have more than that. Since they made it a mandatory stay, I just wanted to leave after a couple weeks and held A LOT back from the therapist they had there. It's actually kind of worrying that even though I held back the majority of my thoughts/problems, I was still diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder.)

Anyway, back to the DPH. The first few weeks are ideal for me. After this, I still get these effects (although I lose some ability to do things once I start losing effective motor control and thought control) but there's a lot added on. At the higher doses, I have no control of my thoughts. If I'm writing a song (rap usually) I can have, say, 2 lines that are really good but by the time I write the first line I've forgotten the second line. I'll find myself sitting for a couple minutes just staring at whatever I'm doing because I just completely lose my grasp on whatever I'm doing. It will get to a point where doing anything but jerking off is just not possible because my brain can't stay on a task for more than a couple minutes. At the even higher doses the hallucinations start.

Now this is the part that makes people completely stay away from DPH recreationally. Most of these things are experienced by everyone who does it high doses, but these are the ones that reoccur with me:

* Spiders everywhere. Even at low doses, some people experience this. They are these strange looking things that appear in the corner of your eyes that can be described as spiders that are almost invisible. They will appear out of the corner of your eye and sometimes you'll feel one on your skin. As the dose gets higher, they start to become more erratic. They convulse as they move, and you can start seeing them directly as opposed to in your peripheral. There's been times where I've been afraid to type because I can see them running around under the keys, their legs convulsing as if they're trying to escape.
* Hearing things. There are many times that I will hear things. Sometimes it's just noises from the other room, at higher doses it's voices. They usually aren't understandable, but there are times when I can hear conversations about me happening outside the door. I'll hear music in the distance of songs that don't exist. If I focus on them they go away, but when I'm distracted I can hear them. They're so vivid there's been times where I've written the lyrics down and used them in my own music.

* Seeing people. This usually happens only on higher doses. It starts as seeing things out of the corner of your eye but they can get much more vivid. Hallucinations with DPH are different than acid or shrooms, at least that's my experience. When you're on ""conventional"" hallucinogens, you know in the back of your mind that they're there because of the drugs. When I'm deep into a DPH high it's different. It's hard to explain, but you actually believe the hallucinations are there but they seem more normal. For example, there was one time I was in my basement and I saw three men on the other side, standing still and watching me. When I looked away they would walk toward me, but when I looked at them they would reset to their original position and not move till I looked away. Sober, this would be fucking terrifying. On acid, I would probably think something along the lines of ""Damn this shit is strong, they look so real this is pretty creepy."" On DPH, though, my thought process is something along the lines of, ""Hmm there's people here with me, that's weird. I wonder why they're here."" There have been countless times that I've had full on conversations with people that weren't there. I honestly believed they were there and carried on like it was normal for, say, my cousin who lives in Ohio to be sitting here with me at 3 in the morning sitting on my floor.

* Trouble speaking. At high doses, my motor functions start to become really shitty. Along with difficultly walking and typing, I just can't seem to talk. I can't bring up the words in my brain and I forget how to say things. And when I remember HOW to say things, it's usually incoherent. 

* Things moving strangely. This is a weird one, but for me it mainly manifests in my hoodies that are hanging and pictures on my wall. My hoodies will start to move and sway as if there's something hiding underneath. My pictures and posters stare at me, usually with a weird angry looking expression. [This fucking poster](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517A6GfrUmL.jpg) is the worst by far. I have a giant poster of this framed on my wall, and his face will contort and his lips will move in weird ways so that it looks like he's just babbling nonsense with no sound. One time it looked like the metal surrounding the bulb in my lamp was expanding and contracting. At the time I thought it was because the bulb was somehow getting so hot that it was melting and solidifying the metal and I was afraid it would explode and kill me.

* Feeling weird sensations. This is usually manifested in the form of feeling things poking me or crawling on me. On DPH I get extremely paranoid and twitchy and if I feel something my body involuntarily jerks away. Like if my clothes moved in a weird way I would flip out as if the fabric was a hot poker, like when you touch the stove and your hand involuntarily shoots back. Another thing that's extremely frustrating is feeling like I'm being electrocuted. It usually happens with my mouse. If I leave my hand on it sometimes, it feels like there's a current being conducted through my PC to the mouse and I'm touching something with a constant charge and it even hurts sometimes. 

In spite of all this, I can't stop. I've tried countless times and I can't. No matter how many times I tell myself it'll be the last time it never is. It's cost me jobs, relationships, and my future prospects are looking progressively grim. 

I don't know why I posted this, honestly. I've just never put these thoughts into words before and I guess I ended up just venting.

So,  I had a fear I was getting addicted to blow( circle I’m in in the “ Club scene”), So I did it a few days ago, and I decided “ I’m not doing it”, but since I kinda have the connect for a lot of people, I always get offered it for free..

So last night, kicked it, club scene, was the connect, got offered it about 9 times  said “ nah, I’m good” and just drank...

I was so stoked, by the 6th “no” I felt disgusted being asked about it.. I conquered it, and I’m glad.. being an addict wouldn’t bode well for my life..I’m so stoked about this.

addiction,fromplsnerf,2018/04/19,"I’ve been clean for 5 years and I’ve never felt better than when I was taking oxy daily It’s very disheartening. Overall I just don’t feel as well as I did then. I don’t sleep as well, and nothing is as interesting as it was. I don’t enjoy talking to people as much either

I will never take those pills again unless I’m required to for surgery or something, because of all the relationships I had that my addiction ruined.

However, i always wish I could because of how shitty I feel now compared to when I was dosing (taking 60mg of oxycodone or 10mg of oxymorphone per day for ~ 6 months)",3.4156466302367967,4.572021803278691,5.172076502732238,82.12529143897997,72.77049180327869,7.38943533697632,26.67030965391621,7.793537801064563,1.5514069216757744,468,16,93,6,9,160,80,122,0.124,0.7659999999999999,0.11,-0.3933,1,0,1,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,2,8,7,0,0,1,0,12,4,1,1,3,17,20,15,0,2,5,0,3,0,0,1,3,0,1,0,4,2,0,1,3,0,0,0,5,2,2,0,7,3,12,5,18,11,3,10,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,10,65,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21282475399758727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1624433640554816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2380154650787128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17266120563259138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15587178056907133,0.0,0.0,0.12590438127629833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1974238896499817,0.0,0.18744722107058145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15582723597282,0.0,0.14351330161407594,0.0,0.30114008355953314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18732425805234731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13534487122293495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20959926636601475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19536662045266465,0.0,0.0,0.15029422847958074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44035613477935504,0.15691496705120547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16108159112246168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3510625755561185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22449984078371651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12571890553520582
addiction,askmartaj,2018/04/19,"A discussion of the current psychological studies of addiction (Rat Park) Has anyone here watched the Ted Talk called ""Everything you know about addiction is wrong""? It touts a study about Rat Park that says that addiction isn't about genetics, or neruochemicals at all, but instead about your environment but I don't really agree. What do you guys think? 
[This podcast](https://whoknewwedidnt.podbean.com/e/study-study-3-addiction/) discusses the rat park study, and picks apart some of the assumptions in it. Full disclosure, this is my podcast but I really want to know what you guys think about it, and your experience with addiction. Is Rat Park correct? Is it all about your environment, or is there more to the picture?",7.182045454545456,10.396296083333336,5.872878787878786,72.38727272727277,67.33333333333334,10.696969696969695,30.90909090909091,10.637119530657019,4.04525,590,24,94,19,11,175,68,120,0.044,0.94,0.016,-0.4785,1,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,0,6,0,0,9,1,0,0,7,0,9,4,0,1,3,18,14,7,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,2,10,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,2,9,0,14,14,5,5,0,0,1,0,13,4,0,3,1,64,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8194781463206909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10512304403723977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15351660752865684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13511823791783115,0.1470639147493276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2977256286769834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16524872621747294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19262664314465472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11955847264802147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1208396898516344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1926669395647824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08867596281248018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16437603579748614,0.0,0.0
addiction,boybye_,2018/04/19,"I feel myself slipping and I’m afraid Wall of text, sorry. Apologize for any typos.
I’m physically sick to my stomach right now I’m so down. I have been doing so great and everyone knows and sees that. I quit heroin and benzos cold turkey in September 2017, aside from a few random instances in the first month or two with a Xanax or Percocet I’ve been clean. I go to the gym 4-5 days a week and am back in college. I’m 25 f. Yesterday though I had a Xanax and a Valium. It all happened so quick. I had no idea there were stages to relapse as I never went to treatment (emotional, mental and finally physical). Having no idea I was emotionally relapsing for a week or two— isolation, sadness turned to depression, letting things around the house go. I have managed to not slack in school as I’m so scared to fail as I would never get the chance again if I do. I am from a very affluent family and I don’t want to live a life of poverty, I know that money is not the root of all evil but quite the opposite and I’m scared to lose my chance at that type of life to be 100% honest. And I never want to live how I did while I was on heroin. I have no support from family however. I am basically scum to the ones who didn’t fall prey to addiction. Most of my cousins have and one aunt is an alcoholic. While I was using I obviously did a lot of things to embarrass and piss off my family. My dad is so misogynistic it’s crazy, hates all women. My mom is some kind of bipolar schizophrenic (I’m not exaggerating: paranoia, mood swings, delusions, the whole nine) and has been jealous of me and has treated me terribly my whole life. The only way they have given me support is financially which I’m very grateful for however I could never ask for help with this. For example, the family you hear about doing interventions and trying to help is no where near mine, my dad told me he didn’t give a fuck about me (exact words) and to get out of his life when I was using. I got clean on my own. They don’t want to hear or talk about addiction, it’s embarrassing to them. So I have to pretend it never happened around them. I have two friends who are very supportive, however. I don’t think they can provide me the amount of support I need though, my one friend has a toddler and is busy and my closest friend lives states away and is in law school. I feel I’m trying to do this alone and I feel myself slipping. I’m not a crier and it just keeps coming. I feel restless and anxious that I will relapse as my small relapse yesterday happened so fast. However, I can still fight as long as I don’t touch heroin. That will break me. I’m scared. I don’t know what to do. I don’t have anything today and I don’t plan to go get anything. I’m just extremely depressed and I don’t know what to do. I would see a therapist but I don’t want to spill the beans about everything as what if I need meds when I’m old for pain or something. I don’t want to be marked as an addict and I managed to make it without a criminal record. Meetings don’t help me as talking about the old days makes me fantasize not feel better about sobriety. I do best not thinking about it in any way that could be positive. But it’s like a switch has flipped in my mind and everything’s crumbling in there and idk how to stop the landslide. Any comments appreciated.",2.143800298062594,4.003166563049857,3.7885096870342814,87.8142399403875,77.65102639296187,7.346031440796115,24.376808807268876,8.249195462096736,1.4255238401999906,2604,90,557,49,61,868,289,682,0.174,0.7190000000000001,0.107,-0.9925,4,2,2,0,1,0,67.0,0,1,5,8,32,35,6,7,31,0,69,17,2,7,10,102,132,61,0,13,19,5,6,1,3,4,14,2,2,1,24,33,1,2,13,2,1,6,29,20,0,7,18,11,76,14,83,104,12,63,0,5,2,1,33,23,2,11,30,378,100,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20007206093601296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06537835985212509,0.0,0.0633597124827862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12480499109285505,0.0,0.0,0.06911127736594554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1006849947466896,0.10891892135674064,0.05719114496698687,0.0,0.057476708127403825,0.047040438795059175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06420026163409819,0.05410505217045211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05269756255298641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0976878481612893,0.0,0.0,0.07890670162396661,0.0,0.1053813092461978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1376291543428504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05845612928988025,0.10996178666320768,0.0,0.23068452031496256,0.0,0.1546616944158182,0.0,0.0,0.06701513391268038,0.0,0.05203613160880658,0.0,0.0,0.14179288858947334,0.056556071085081365,0.09588554213915923,0.05868543263851773,0.10430290569290962,0.0,0.04892790152066903,0.0674465709587212,0.0,0.0,0.16229275910699067,0.0,0.0,0.06039846901559698,0.0,0.0,0.1378992180035262,0.0,0.12301461235652272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07058869672237209,0.0,0.13812013638839954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054375890509837925,0.0,0.06370521523480298,0.1344825499407626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06255643320333172,0.17284119783930954,0.029887421497208168,0.0,0.16205814184992282,0.054138686396646665,0.0,0.06844010804834602,0.0,0.05200950485915756,0.0,0.0,0.08167068604939354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0679525584585141,0.0,0.061650850137851085,0.0,0.061770151242098774,0.07164839528693615,0.04882996560227506,0.0,0.0,0.09072220882490364,0.2359128657753239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1283874900007475,0.0,0.12436298140401306,0.04652697706878625,0.06509539866663266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13013605563138933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05224382643087145,0.0,0.0,0.18374304069608213,0.12382641639541242,0.09749843558687404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047096144400318236,0.0,0.06848133559713468,0.0,0.0,0.04885509861067842,0.0511457349829612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27768643760950384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09834163322936627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07102985629900857,0.0812850091756799,0.07839800619054653,0.12020988903928218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057987535813459785,0.05845612928988025,0.0,0.08306874873932947,0.06654173833987502,0.17927969655953668,0.0,0.0,0.10567255421020176,0.0,0.1514294052236444,0.18041545418299293,0.09711705618304654,0.09814312502640796,0.0,0.0,0.05671060933421821,0.0,0.13660126384959806,0.0,0.058971319166135815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0869151119342731,0.0,0.0,0.0
addiction,Anonymous_NeedsHelp,2018/04/19,"Porn took over my hobby. THIS has to end. I love making games on my computer. Hell I love to just think of cool game concepts and write them down.


Just recently I started to make a new game from scratch. When I hit a road block I'd search YouTube for an answer. However that sometimes leads to procrastination on YouTube.


But when I run into enough road blocks my mind switches to wanting to view porn...


However over the years of doing this my porn viewing has gotten darker and darker. It's at the point now where I will actively search for cheese pizza. And my mind new it was wrong. The first time I ever got off on it I instantly regretted it. But you know what? I came back to it. Normal porn didn't do it for me anymore, the smaller the pizza, the harder I got off. And my brain loved it. It's probably been about 6 months now of casual viewing the content. During this time I was actually determined to stop... turns out my body ached... ACHED for it. And I couldn't resist the urge.


Today was the last straw. I actually got the courage to search online for ways I can stop this addiction. Who can I contact. What can I do to prevent this in the future. I know talking to people about addiction is supposed to help, thus the reason for writing this.

It's a very sensitive topic, I know. But I feel if I take this first step in acknowledging this then... maybe... just maybe I can hope to prevent future incidents from occurring. And maybe someone will see this post who is in the same position as me. I hope you do see this post whoever you are. And I hope we can together make something of ourselves other than shackles of addiction.


Let's take out hobbies back.",2.3638417921546733,4.741604941717792,3.50137757947574,87.55465606990148,79.33742331288343,6.773601041085705,24.295965792898308,7.898369717300924,1.4138805725971375,1305,47,259,23,33,421,166,326,0.063,0.8220000000000001,0.115,0.9356,2,0,1,0,0,0,48.0,1,3,1,3,13,12,1,0,17,1,23,14,2,6,1,51,51,15,0,8,7,0,2,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,26,12,2,6,8,4,0,5,2,3,0,2,11,8,37,9,45,35,2,52,1,1,5,7,18,19,1,4,25,175,63,3,0.0,0.0,0.19098461225293584,0.32002898704023025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0970458065115216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15048881794970267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10869477901377422,0.0,0.10923847610503262,0.0,0.11191998301199088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0866704323464439,0.10111031175093546,0.0,0.0,0.08851539593079809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049478398099422616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16647072470138108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23479060527104334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06559010388461202,0.0,0.0,0.2915761064833349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1613355484173298,0.07976483698509759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10006330647693397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2649537127823958,0.0,0.1959567978031716,0.0,0.2949253208156116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1976111890770493,0.0,0.07810687987016439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18901782250310095,0.0,0.0,0.09587706506198464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0678402946163824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09250454822958673,0.0,0.1874359666788931,0.0,0.10550417643073004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10061117649162554,0.09661994837843413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15595543642074824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08291217348516741,0.07533351391204306,0.09678103824142202,0.0,0.06926223050141607,0.0,0.0,0.1636222237272799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14714947402947492,0.07865209444796334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06270149462587499,0.0,0.0,0.11412000540055592,0.0,0.09275504166109297,0.0,0.10872043938119233,0.0,0.10643807544731054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08074057406300643,0.057717379206737036,0.07767269695024936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1069890158473526,0.0,0.06301537334435954
addiction,TheWarriorlife,2018/04/20,"Legacy I am writing to you seeking out help, but to be honest i was hesitating whether i should write or not as i haven't had the help i need from anyone i reached out to online, however am scratching , screaming and flapping around like a pinned down eagle because i wanna end this particular chapter in my life and get out what's inside of me, that's dying to get out to this world.

I've been a porn abuser for almost 13 years now, i'am 20 years old. I started fighting it off for 4 years now but as it is a heavy addiction where it escalated to watching weird stuff to get that dopamine high which pretty much destroyed a lot of stuff in my life when i succumbed to it.

When i started to get out of it bit by bit i found myself like a child re-learning how to walk again, i was learning about myself, the world, life itself and when i started to claw myself out back to the reality only to see a glimpse of it before another relapse.

It was a major twist where i was shocked how much i was living in a fantasy world made of my own illusion that immediately crumbled down in the face of reality.

This addiction gets worse and worse whenever i fight it, I have never made it past 7 or 10 days, sometimes ever 3 or 2!

I would put out my goals and a solid plan, but then the next day i wake up like i' have got my brain formatted to nothing, like i haven't decided to get rid of this addiction or not. I would just automatically respond to the urge with a relapse like nothing was planned, that and an endless cycle of ""Start again tomorrow"" where tomorrow never comes.

Ever since this way of living also the deep rooted weird escalation of porn, where a lot of money is spent , a lot of time is wasted and when i purge to throw away the stuff related to the addiction, the cycle restarts itself after a major urge hits me like nothing happened or it was just a moment where i was only upset.

This way of living has got me chained where : am obese with 25% fat for over 14 years where i forgot what is it like to be fit or even without a belly, it got me to the point where i procrastinate a lot whether it's my studying, goals or important tasks , where i sit at home with a routine where i started to see my home as my prison of just sitting on the bed using phone, using PC to play video games or watching movies and that's all, i do nothing at all other than that, i would go out occasionally with my friends or just the routine of going to college to attend lectures only to go home and throw the notebook and leave the lectures unstudied until a few days before the exam.

I have a vision, dream and goals of my own life, i know what i want in life. However this has been the hardest tide that i have been facing ever, i wake up some days and wonder if i know what i want, why can't i achieve any of them at all, even the simplest of them all..

Why can't i close this chapter in my life already for that i know i can't erase this chapter or tear the page from the book for that it has already happened and left its scars.

My mind, my soul and my heart. I was surprised when i saw the potential i had, the way i tend to think and the way that sometimes i live spontaneously that comes from deep deep inside of me.

There's someone underneath those shackles waiting to be awakened, someone so strong that's waiting to get out to this world. I do remember when i told someone when i started, it came out by itself : I wanna open myself to the world!

Porn leading to relapses leading to binge eating due to hunger after a relapse leading to obesity leading to laziness leading to waste of money on the addiction and junk food everyday even when i wanna save money. leading to a self-esteem issue, where i could say i have 50% only because i know i haven't lived out to be the true me.

Apologies for this really long message and the complaining. I just wish that i stop ""wishing"" , ironic huh?

I wanna leave a legacy behind when i die, not spend my entire life being drowned in addiction. But how? This has gone so long that i dunno how to get rid of it.

Thank you in advance.",7.423101000625392,5.687562247560978,7.734146341463418,77.06153533458412,64.32926829268294,10.263914946841775,35.293933708567856,8.768130331264683,2.8276213258286425,3193,117,642,38,39,1051,323,820,0.092,0.807,0.102,0.7551,2,0,0,0,4,0,70.0,0,2,2,14,46,24,3,1,50,1,48,28,7,15,10,128,101,55,3,15,26,0,1,7,1,4,16,2,4,1,56,38,6,4,10,6,5,19,12,9,0,0,26,8,89,15,122,64,19,133,1,0,5,3,20,58,0,19,57,463,145,18,0.0,0.06310906142928506,0.0,0.3483933526870429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05333614390479848,0.0,0.11755616887246575,0.04259515513555747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03622130702599071,0.05585188730568516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03724338666141528,0.0,0.0,0.047416200949051183,0.0,0.0,0.05004322680597832,0.04095668357442896,0.0,0.06493840927222731,0.0,0.09064738305349927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11630085874388366,0.0,0.0,0.05946017466204012,0.0,0.060919759917439524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09176433936041586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04252692352254401,0.0,0.0,0.13740334457314302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11055912490921653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05450230997493402,0.0,0.0,0.04717604299421994,0.0,0.0,0.1055409939459684,0.14454085474236356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0644069700340731,0.058401163116762286,0.04115158942546037,0.0,0.2226256902557409,0.0,0.09081337703862358,0.0,0.1278001203989625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09420225592317667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06311802766940948,0.07140339506989359,0.05627627906599142,0.16028422996371855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05559371699168154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11708987809834535,0.0,0.0,0.11279764764289588,0.05787142877941277,0.0,0.2633532818199065,0.18215450100599784,0.0,0.235165182922867,0.09427382501863883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1811323948451754,0.0,0.10079925948709233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05378139752882118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07831025192536506,0.03949453805270537,0.08216087130302473,0.0,0.05664680653256485,0.0,0.0,0.20443275535893074,0.0,0.05589154711954004,0.0,0.0,0.16203851207962303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05084645953417013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05035164157247832,0.0,0.0,0.054188577698320056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05354497326158874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03412224511585407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06033766304706556,0.0,0.0,0.04235762449859346,0.0,0.0,0.08488893126041303,0.0,0.05556590789039608,0.0,0.0,0.04406048319736793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1353910955045894,0.0,0.10535880109267512,0.0,0.2262029535712436,0.0,0.0,0.044531040473601284,0.0,0.0,0.18292341074691298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0490382815134295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034129383299349565,0.0,0.0,0.031058632889686588,0.0,0.0,0.050895979111551186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09200588846852996,0.0,0.0,0.06283290596928567,0.169113751557388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09612484587158314,0.0,0.12250180917900964,0.05134453931385875,0.057762472959672774,0.0,0.0,0.10856101463061016,0.113511528437379,0.0,0.0,0.13720092916150325
addiction,rowaway321,2018/04/20,"Can you be addicted but not actively taking/seeking drugs In my last relationship, I was introduced to oxy. Never took any drugs before this, didn't even smoke weed. We took pills daily for a few months on and off. I've never felt better than I did at that time. We lost our source for the pills and I had a pretty bad panic attack about it. I realized that I was probably addicted/on the path to addiction and got scared so I stopped doing drugs. I still sometimes will take adderall/xanax but I don't feel the same craving for them as I do for oxy. Every now and then I will get strong cravings for it, even though I haven't had any for over a year. I find the cravings come when I'm depressed or when I see people on TV taking drugs. The thing is I have no way to get them and I'm not really trying to find someone to get it from. If I happened upon some percocet or something though, I'd honestly probably take it. Is this addiction? Or something else? 

Another thing is my boyfriend now has no idea. He knows I did pills in the past but he doesn't know I feel this way now. He's told me before he doesn't want to be with an addict, so i'm sure he'd break up with me if he found out.",1.0535200000000025,3.0664749120000003,2.8004,92.7962,81.88,6.24,20.4,7.404127859558343,0.5088399999999997,928,26,208,14,25,307,135,250,0.159,0.778,0.063,-0.9737,0,0,7,0,0,0,24.0,3,1,2,3,13,10,1,2,10,0,24,11,0,0,3,38,48,21,0,3,10,0,3,0,0,2,11,0,0,0,11,11,0,1,10,1,0,3,11,6,0,0,14,4,28,4,28,29,3,31,0,2,1,0,14,10,0,6,15,135,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4155688947650573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12961597928010568,0.09993147213840052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10841871524199373,0.0,0.0,0.07957240538802894,0.0,0.0,0.16218836768131234,0.0,0.0,0.08428604408765313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0820934257056046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0820826643800038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4420758997080092,0.0,0.0796118078815449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12589090425594354,0.0,0.0802952543762077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09637416005540364,0.0,0.09150396397024144,0.0,0.17420688685569036,0.0,0.0,0.10449269463198352,0.0,0.0,0.14937261323857184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07622096457268789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08427441369741485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10758329802871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10474994181335814,0.07768308455488056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1040323660893992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07606839783807845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1470041070688973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11181526157716762,0.0,0.0,0.09097564647127013,0.06606975632504633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09695544060742986,0.20550132535449603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061052300138612375,0.0,0.0,0.10231767432029906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09541298768255126,0.0,0.07594260711978726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08074827990534887,0.14673482582654465,0.09425518638522568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07610755059312373,0.0796759544762725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08982012235508745,0.0,0.2149636130148467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1266275808303947,0.0,0.18726561755114865,0.0,0.05557081518634012,0.0,0.0,0.09106424802989388,0.21176597118529408,0.06470316484024194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056211035071014284,0.1512910929892362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0613707588555822
